    "Technology_Description": "UTB Envirotec Zrt, is one of the Central European market leaders in engineering services for wastewater and organic waste treatment. In the past few years, we have developed a technology for sustainable valorisation of sewage sludge. The treatment of this sludge represents one of the biggest problems for small and medium sized wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in Europe. In our process, called reNEW, the sewage sludge is biologically transformed into volatile fatty acids (VFA) and valuable nutrients (NPK), which are recovered. These products represent important market value: VFA as raw material for eco labelled cleaning agents, and NPK as fertilizer. With the aim of exploitation of the reNEW technology, we formed a spin-off company, Renew Technologies Ltd (RNT) in the UK. Our final aim is to roll-out the technology and widely implement it all over Europe, enabling the growth of our companies. We aim to realise the reNEW project in cooperation of the two companies: RNT being the technology owner and responsible for commercial exploitation, while UTB being the technology provider (design, building and implementation of plants). This initiative has received funding in the Horizon 2020 SME Instrument Phase 1, project number: 728932, duration: 01/07/2016-31/12/2016. We have successfully completed the feasibility study. We verified the technological feasibility as well as the economic viability of the project and further improved our business concept. We demonstrated the efficiency and economic value of the two products, VFA and NPK, respectively and made a scale-up design of our pilot operating currently at our premises (TRL=6). We have improved the proposal and discussed it with our clients, technical partners, and the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN). These discussions and the results of the feasibility assessment have reassured us regarding its merit.",

    "Technology_Description": "Mastitis is one of the most widespread and costly diseases in the dairy industry, inflicting serious damages on a global scale.In herds without an effective mastitis control program, 40 % of cows are infected every 6 months. Treatment of mastitis costs ca. \u20ac185 per cow per year. Antibiotic treatment is currently the only solution for treating bacterial mastitis. The antibiotic treatment causes very large losses in milk production and degradation of milk quality, and creates bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics. For many years, scientists all over the world tried to find a non-antibiotic treatment against mastitis. We have developed a highly innovative technology that heals mastitis without resorting to antibiotics. Based on the energetic signature of mastitis pathogens received from the farm computer, our system processes the cows\u2019 drinking water using radio emissions. Infected cows that drink the treated water are healed from mastitis without the need for antibiotics. A working prototype of the system was tested at a 300-cows dairy farm, successfully healing 39 out of the 49 sick cows. Apart from the healing effect, the new treatment facilitates compliance with major EU health regulations. The project will study the requirements for large scale production and delivery of the technology to the dairy industry. It will boost the EU business in milk production and create large environmental, economic and social benefits. Market drivers and a 5-year growth potential will be analysed and a commercialisation strategy will be devised, along with an IPR protection strategy, analysis of competing technologies and planning of promotional and partnership activities. This will enable us to redesign the technology for serial production and scale up for a successful market entry.",

    "Technology_Description": "In irrigation water cannot be decoupled from energy. Raising water from rivers and canals and distribute it to the crops requires pumping of large volumes of water with a sizeable amount of pressure, which is generated by means of electric energy or by fuel-driven pumps. This turns into a substantial increase of energy consumption and capital expenditure, which has become a real concern for farmers and their communities. Besides, sharp increases in energy tariffs almost doubled the energy bills that irrigators have to pay, which accounts for up to 40% of the total irrigation costs for farmers\u2019 communities. In a context exacerbated by the ongoing climate change, European farmers are striving to reduce their water footprint by means of water saving irrigation technologies while optimising their energy costs for pumping, with the aim to ensure long- term economic and environmental sustainability. To address this global need, aQysta has designed the HyPump, an innovative spiral pump which converts the energy from the flow of existing irrigation canals to pressure for pumping water, delivering pressurized water directly to the agriculture plots without requiring any fuel nor electricity to be operated. This Phase 2 is focussed on the industrialisation and field tests of the HyPump, which will allow farmers obtaining up to 75% savings on the overall costs for modernizing infrastructures and running an irrigation system with respect to competing electric or fuel-driven solutions, and up to 37% savings with respect to solar pumps. Through the Cost Benefit Analysis run during Phase 1, annual net savings have been estimated in the range of 5k\u20ac-8k\u20ac per hectare with respect to electric pumping. Besides, a payback time in the range of 2,5-4 years has been estimated when switching from an electric or fuel- operated system to the HyPump, obtained with zero environmental footprint with respect to fuel or energy powered pumps.",

Paper cups are often lined or coated with plastic such as polyethylene (PE) or oil- based waxes to prevent the liquid from leaking out or soaking through the paper. These paper cups are almost impossible to recycle because of the difficulties of separating the paper from waterproof oil-based liners.

Kabola has a broad portfolio of diesel, heating oil and biodiesel boilers adapted to the requirements of its customers. Kabola is well known for its classic red cube heaters HR, Compact 7 and B series. In the last years, the increasing pressure for more efficient and greener heating systems encouraged Kabola to develop the new Kabola Blue Ecoline (KB Eco) series. The KB Eco is the outcome of the implementation of the innovative Kabola Blue technology (The Kabola Blue technology allows diesel to burn a blue flame at around 1.500 \u00baC compared to the 800 \u00baC of the yellow flame in conventional systems) into the successful HR series. In comparison with its competitors, KB Eco is much more efficient (94% constant over time vs. a degradable 70-90%) and it does not produce soot (both certified by T\u00dcV), it has the best low emission values (NOx, CO, etc) granted with the eco-label \u201cBlauer Engel\u201d (Blue Angel) and require very low maintenance since there is no soot production. KB Eco is sold now with power outputs from 7 kW to 38 kW. The current KB Eco series is highly efficient and clean, however there are still needs not covered in the market that guarantee the profitability of an improved KB Ecoline version (KB Plus) that will include: a new ultra compact model for vehicles with high restrictions in terms of space such as trucks or vans, higher efficiency in all models reaching an outstanding 106% efficiency thanks to a new design and technology, a new range of higher output power models for large boats, availability of clean water a valuable resource in ships, electrical heating and other improvements. Highly efficient and non pollutant heating systems for vehicles represent a huge business opportunity. Proof of that is the 700 units of the KB Eco sold in the last 2 years. KB Plus will boost the current sales of the KB Eco.",

In this process, which was developed in cooperation with the HAWK university in Germany, organic contaminants in the wastewater are converted into biogas under anaerobic conditions in a fixed-bed reactor. An optional second treatment step, a trickling filter, can moreover remove nitrogen compounds and further increase the treatment efficiency of the plant. Compared to the aerobic activated sludge process, which currently is the most important process for the treatment of organically contaminated wastewater, the FLEXBIO process has several important advantages: at a comparable treatment efficiency (more than 97 %), the FLEXBIO process requires much less energy (heating or aeration not necessary), produces much less sludge to be disposed of, is much more flexible to variations in the wastewater, can be installed in a compact and mobile container and produces biogas for the generation of heat or electricity. The FLEXBIO process offers an environmentally friendly solution for the decentralised treatment of wastewater especially for SMEs, clearly improving their economic performance.",

    "Technology_Description": "More than a billion people currently live in water-scarce regions, and as many as 3.5 billion could experience water scarcity   by 2025. Forecasts estimate that water demand in 2040 will exceed supply by 50%. Seawater amounts to 97% of all water   contained on Earth and can, fortunately, be converted into fresh water by desalination. Desalination processes are still expensive, energy intensive and commonly pose great negative impacts on ecosystems. Presently, no current state-of-the-art solutions suggest sustainable technologies to the Earth\u2019s ecosystem. The Reverse Osmosis (RO) membrane segment, which is the largest of the membrane market, was valuated at \u20ac1.1 billion in 2015 and is projected to grow by 43% over the 8-year period from 2014 to 2021, reaching a \u20ac2.5 billion revenue by 2021. Part of the RO market is dominated by brackish water reverse osmosis membranes (BWRO). Brackish water is water that has higher salinity than fresh water (more than 0.05%) and lower than seawater (less than 3%). Aquaporin A/S has acknowledged this huge business opportunity and has developed a ground-breaking biomimetic technology to separate and purify water from other compounds based on nature\u2019s own principles: Aquaporin water channel proteins. This technology will potentially disrupt the current RO technology, making it more energy and water efficient as well as more sustainable and cost-effective. Since we have a commercial Aquaporin Inside\u2122 RO membrane already tested and validated at low pressure conditions (house hold, 7 bar), our main goal within this project will be to optimise and up-scale this to work at brackish water conditions (15 bar) in both flat sheet and spiral wound module formats. Aquaporin Inside\u2122 Brackish Water RO membranes will boost our growth and consolidate a worldwide reference for us, thereby drastically differentiate us from competitors, and will open the possibility to also get into the seawater desalination market in the near future.",

    "Technology_Description": "Company ESDA has developed HeatSel\u00ae, the first viable macro-encapsulation solution functioning with phase change materials (PCM) for latent thermal energy storage in heating and cooling systems. Accounting for 50% of the EU's annual energy consumption, heating and cooling is the sector with the biggest energy-saving potential in Europe, and urgently needs to become more sustainable. In the low temperature range (5 to +100\u00b0C), most thermal energy amounts are required and then discarded worldwide. PCM are key materials to save these huge energy and \u2013 at the same time \u2013 CO2 amounts. They can run through a reproducible phase-change at a substance-specific temperature, during which the thermal energy is either stored in very large amounts or returned at a constant temperature. Since decades, an adequate method is being sought to transfer PCM into a user-friendly form. Both existing micro- and macro-encapsulation solutions for PCM storage have until now revealed industrially, technically and economically inappropriate. Sensible heat storage with large water storage tanks has very low energy density and storage capacity. ESDA is specialist in the technical extrusion of blow-moulded parts and has in the past 5 years acquired expert knowledge in PCM and thermal storage technology. HeatSel\u00ae is a PCM-filled capsule for use in aqueous systems as a heat transfer medium. Most unique selling points of the solution are: universal applicability with diverse (even older) heat exchangers; high energy efficiency through the re-use of waste energy (4 times more efficient than water heat storage) and boosting of renewable energy such as solar thermal technology. Primary target market is the high-volume heating and cooling market in residential buildings in Europe, secondary market is industrial process heat/cooling. ESDA foresees a large impact for HeatSel\u00ae in combination with solar thermal and heat pump systems, with a cumulated turnover of \u20ac33.7M and 56 job creations by 2023.",

    "Technology_Description": "Sphagnum peat moss is a valued, recognized, natural, organic reserve that is largely harvested for use as a soil conditioner or amendment in horticulture. It is often referred to as the universal soil conditioner for its benefits to the soil. The decayed and dried sphagnum peat moss is usually referred to as simply peat. As a soil amendment, it is free of weed seeds, pests and pathogens and can absorb up to 20 times its weight in water. The peat bogs from which peat moss is derived are one of the most distinctive kinds of wetlands. Peat bogs are an important environmental resource and create areas of huge biodiversity, keeping more carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere than forests, and helping to prevent flooding. Problem: Naturally formed peat has been harvested for centuries, and European supplies are seriously depleted in England, Holland and Germany, and are in the process of being commercially harvested in areas of Eastern Europe. This harvesting causes serious environmental problems, as the peat cannot be regenerated within our lifetimes. Habitats are destroyed, and the carbon balance is badly affected, as peatlands are major stores of carbon and are vital environmental \u2018regulators\u2019. Many peatlands globally, which have been farmed for peat, are now sources of greenhouse gases, owing to degradation and oxidation of the unsaturated peat layer. The UK government are currently working to completely phase out the use of peat based products in UK Horticulture by 2030, but there is presently no viable alternative growing media which offers the same quality as peat. This project is to determine the business opportunity for the commercialisation of a method to grow moss on a large scale, on mats, which will speed up significantly the growing process, enabling the production of a sustainable growing media for horticulture (replacing peat) and creating a valuable cash crop opportunity for farmers.",

    "Technology_Description": "Hose reel irrigation systems are a type of sprinkler irrigation which is best used on irregular-shaped and difficult-to-reach areas. Although it is widely used, it presents some problems related to the high degree of friction between the hose carrying the water, and the ground. This fact implies larger labor force to move the hose, therefore provoking an inefficient use of resources (water and fuel); thus increasing fuel consumption and GHG emissions. This becomes particularly difficult at the time of rainy or muddy grounds by getting the hose stuck on the soil with no possibility to move and with the eventual broken of the hose or even the machine drive system. Moreover, the abrasion produced by the constant friction, deteriorates the hose, reducing its useful life. ",

    "Project_ACR": ["EcoLeather"],
    "Technology_Description": "Materiko is an Italian company specialising in the manufacture of revolutionary artificial high quality textiles. Due to the flexibility, and high-quality afforded by genuine leather, compared to conventional textiles, it has been used for centuries as material in several industries. However, leather is prone to scratching, water damage and UV damage which can limit its uses, particularly in external applications. Furthermore, the way in which leather is produced presents a huge environmental problem. The tanning process for genuine leather uses on average 360 L of water per m2 and over 50 L of that needs to be processing by wastewater treatment plants for chromium waste considered to be hugely toxic by the EU. To alleviate these environmental problems as well as consumer movement towards non-animal origin products a range of artificial leathers have been developed such as PVC and polyurethane (PU) based faux leathers and natural plant based options. PVC and PU based artificial leather have their own environmental problems including similarly high water usage, use of toxic chemicals and poor recyclability. Both plastic based and plant based leather alternatives have durability and quality issues when replicating genuine leather. The need for a high-quality, more durable, weather-proof leather like material which eliminates animal cruelty, water usage and toxic wastage associated with the genuine leather industry is clear and one for which Materiko have developed an innovative solution. Our EcoLeather is a novel material manufactured using an innovative semi-automatic manufacturing technique which produces a water and chemical free leather alternative which improves upon the physical properties of genuine, such as durability, scratch and weather resistance. With the high-end leather goods market worth an estimated \u20ac45 bn globally there is a huge demand for a leather alternative with improved physical properties.",

With direction drilling programmes now exceeding 10km, problems are becoming more common and expensive as oil exploration companies look to access difficult to extract oil reserves from reservoirs which until recently were not commercially viable, particularly in deep water. Methods of disconnecting the BHA need to be activated in highly deviated or horizontal wells where wireline systems cannot easily be employed. In development and exploration drilling, the costs when the BHA becomes stuck down the hole are considerable. ",

    "Technology_Description": "Greenhouses in Europe and Mediterranean produce 30% of the EU\u2019s fruits and vegetables. Growing irrigation water resource pressures are driving greenhouse growers to use of more efficient irrigation techniques, and of non-potable water sources. These lead to a strong need for irrigation water treatment (IWT), to eliminate water-borne plant and human pathogens, mitigate clogging by bio-foul and secure reliable and uniform irrigation, and improve water oxygenation. Our goal is to bring to market a novel irrigation water treatment (IWT) solution based on our technology breakthroughs in on-site generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Our autonomous H2O2 generation device (HPGen) enables the safe, cost-effective and sustainable on-site generation of hydrogen peroxide, with only water, air and electricity as input. Hydrogen peroxide is a potent but eco-friendly disinfection agent, yet its use in IWT is very limited due the costs, risks and complexities of its present-day supply chain. HPGen will disrupt today\u2019s H2O2 supply chain, enabling growers to reap the benefits of its use in IWT, substantially decreasing IWT and irrigation line maintenance costs, eliminating use of toxic-chemicals in IWT, improving farm safety, and increasing crop yields. HPGen will provide farmers with a positive economic impact of \u20ac4k-\u20ac5k per hectare per annum, while enhancing agriculture sustainability and reducing environmental impact. Technology breakthrough was made at the Danish Technical University 5 years ago, and a commercialization path was launched 2 years ago by HPNow ApS, a Danish SME. The company has since been highly successful in scaling up its technology, while attracting strong commercial partners, including global leaders in agriculture irrigation and in bulk hydrogen peroxide production, which are actively supporting this project. This project will initiate with pilot and customer trials of a full-scale version (TRL 6), and will end with commercial launch of HPGen (TRL 9).",

Current chemicals production procedures of wet and dry granulation have difficulties with universality, waste ingredients and energy consumption. Nutraceutical formulation requires repetitive research and testing to prove viability and is an extremely inefficient, time-consuming process (lasting up to several months). The Aerodynamic Granulation System (AGS) is a new process of dry granulation that revolutionises the formulation process and successfully manufactures any drug. The system uses a gas flow to optimise particle transportation and granule separation. The system is eco-sustainable as less raw materials are input and waste can be recycled through the use of a continuous process in a closed system. The AGS method reduces formulation time from several months to one day. At peak performance the AGS could produce more than one new formulation per week and a basic machine would have capacity to produce 1 tonne a day. The system concept will initially be applied to the nutraceutical markets; however, any product that requires the combination of chemicals to form a homogeneous compound can utilize this technique including the pharmaceutical market. An advanced prototype AGS has been constructed and trialled in an operational environment and a variety of products have been formulated. Within the overall project Polibiotech intend to: construct a second pilot plant in Italy; engineer a series of online quality control tests; validate the full scale AGS line for the production of nutraceutical compounds and gain certification for manufacturing roll out within the EU.",

Desalination becomes in many parts of the world, and also in Europe, a promising option to combat water stress. Nonetheless, desalination plants generate huge volumes of concentrates, also known as brines, which represent a potential hazard for marine ecosystems. Brines form a very dense hypersaline plume (heavier than normal seawater) that spreads over large areas affecting marine ecosystems, especially to seagrass meadows which are one of the most ecologically important ecosystems in coastal areas. ECOS has developed VENTURI+ a diffuser solution, with a capacity of minimizing in a 99% the environmental impact associated to brines discharges due to a potential dilution capacity 131% higher than conventional diffusers. Thus, VENTURI+ represents a technological leap towards tackling one of the most robust environmental barriers that are holding the full deployment of desalination plants.",

    "Technology_Description": "Three out of four people in EU drink water from groundwater subjected to severe nitrate contamination by fertilizers and sanitary products used in intensive agriculture & farming. High levels of nitrates in drinking water put human health at risk and have been reported to threaten 26% of EU biodiversity. Current technologies do not meet the needs of small water suppliers, who must face costs derived from high energy consumption (3-7 kWh/m3), poor nitrate selectivity, residual streams and by-products, and continuous costly maintenance. 33% of suppliers in Europe are not compliant with quality standards, particularly nitrate levels. ZIRONITRO is the result of 8 years of research and development by Ofra Aqua Plants, an Israeli company with over 25 years\u2019 experience in bioengineering and phytoremediation. Based on the concept of using nature to cleanse nature, ZIRONITRO is a constructed wetland to biologically treat groundwater by removing nitrates to obtain high-quality drinking water (98% removal), at 84% lower cost than current. ZIRONITRO\u2019s innovation resides in the system\u2019s nitrate removal specificity, with a design that allows low-cost operation and maintenance, along with very high rates of nitrate breakdown by bacteria. The key factor is the selection of the best combination of both bacteria and plants, along with the optimal proportion of methanol as carbon source. The particular environment we have generated inside our ponds reduces hydraulic retention time by 90% and uses 100 times less ethanol than current constructed wetlands. Indeed, we do not use synthetic chemicals, energy input needed is negligible, and neither residuals nor wastewater are generated, so it has no negative impact on the environment. On the contrary, it contributes to both biodiversity conservation and landscape value. For 2020-2022, we forecast \u20ac61.3 M cumulative revenues (profitability ratio of 12%), increasing workforce to 40 people.",

    "Technology_Description": "\"Flying SpArk is a food technology company which focuses on finding new ways of incorporating insect protein into food products for human consumption to support access to alternative protein sources as well as to increase food supply. Insects, even though less popular in the Western world, have been a part of diets of many peoples in various regions around the world for centuries. Flying SpArk\u2019s protein powder made of the Mediterranean fruit fly, has many clear advantages to other sources of protein. Among these they have a better nutritional value compared to animal and non-animal derived proteins as well as other insects. Moreover, insects have a higher feed conversion efficiency than animals, for example, every 10kg of feed provides 1kg of beef and 5kg of chicken, compared to 8-9kg of insects. Flying SpArk\u2019s edge lies in the selection of the insect for production of the protein powder: the Mediterranean fruit fly, which has never been used for human consumption before. It is more efficient in farming and feeding in relation to the amount and quality of the protein product in comparison to e.g. crickets, locusts, and even more compared to livestock, and it is less expensive also to the consumers. Fruit flies are also cholesterol, antibiotic, hormone, and pesticide free. Their farming requires relatively less resources as they require much less water and feed, and produce less waste, manure, and methane than conventional livestock. Flying SpArk\u2019s innovative project provides an opportunity to address relevant challenges faced by European societies \u2013 mainly related to provide adequate supply for high-quality food while enhancing innovation and sustainability in production processes. By using food waste in the fruit flies\u2019 diet Flying SpArk contributes to \"closing the loop\" of food lifecycles through re-use, and bring benefits for both the environment and the economy.\"",

    "Technology_Description": "Agricultural technology is among the most revolutionary and impactful areas of modern technology driven by the fundamental need for feeding an ever-growing population. Its development has to serve the agriculture that is environmentally sustainable and cost competitive. That means fewer pesticides application, less water consumption and more efficient use of machines. Excessive use of pesticides for the suppression of insect pests, diseases and weeds has significant impact on the human health and environment. It is estimated that about 50% of all pesticides applied do not reach their intended target consequently increasing negative impact on environment, but also production costs thus implying that application of pesticides have to bedone with higher accuracy. Agriculture production cost is furthermore burdened by high cost of crop protection, particularly in grapes and other fruits growth. In permanent and close cooperation with fruit growers TEYME has recognized the mentioned challenges and developed technology to enable reducing the use and negative impact of pesticide. TEYME has improved the existing state of the art pneumatic sprayers for vineyards by patented spraying technology supported by guidance system based on video input. The control system is capable of controlling the spraying rate of individual spraying nozzles based on video input algorithms. Machine vision algorithms are providing information about canopy, foliage density and all necessary data that not only guide the process of spraying but also provide vital data for farmer such as growth rate and health status of the vineyard. TEYME's solution under TEVINS brand name will decrease use of pesticides in vineyard and orchard up to 60% and reduce it operations cost up to 25%.

Conventional pesticides are synthetic materials that directly kill or inactivate the pest mainly produced from non-renewable resources. There is an increasing demand for residue-free crop protection products, which lesser or none negative impact on environment and better safety features such as biopesticides which are naturally occurring substances that control pests by non-toxic mechanisms, more efficient and formulated to specifically affect a concrete target pest, in contrast to the broad spectrum of conventional pesticides that may affect many other organisms as birds, insects and mammals through the food chain. When used as a component of the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) and Integrated Crop Management (ICM) programs, biopesticides can greatly decrease the use of conventional ones, while not affecting the crop yields.  Biopesticides are also suitable for Organic Agriculture. The BLOSTER project aims to produce different kinds of biopesticides, showing clearly economic (competitiveness in price, creation of market opportunities for the proposer company KIMITEC and other European plant growers and green residues\u2019 suppliers, encouragement of farmers\u2019 competitiveness at global level), quality (R&D based solutions tested and validated following a pharmacological approach, controlled high quality raw material), safety (less use of chemical products, benefiting EU consumers and farmers at international level) and environmental (better use of natural resources with regards to the raw material used (W2R), less impact on the biodiversity, soil, water and air, less ecological footprint by avoiding raw material transport from third countries, is it will be produced in EU) advantages against the current conventional pesticides.",

Besides, there is an increased awareness for shipping contribution to GHG emissions (2.5% global CO2 emissions). Hybrid propulsion systems (fuelled plus electric) have been used for years in large ships to reduce energy consumption, lower polluting emissions and improve manoeuvrability. However, until recently, it has not been possible to apply the quot;state of the artquot; to small and medium size crafts primarily because of the space limitation of these vessels. AuxiliaTM is an innovative patented universal, compact, plug and play hybrid drive for commercial and recreational vessels (tug boats, fishing, off-shore, yachts, public transport, etc.) with diesel engines up to 2.000 kW (up to 40 m lenght). Unlike its competitors, it is easily implemented in quot;new buildquot; and quot;on the waterquot; ships adapting to its size limitations, since it is mounted in the diesel engine housing and rapidly integrated in the propulsion system shaft line \u200bwithout changes in the propulsion system configuration. AuxiliaTM has been developed by Realizzazioni Tecniche Navalmeccaniche (RTN) an Italian SME with more than 48 year experience in marine propulsion. This innovation has been possible thanks to technical advances in electric motors and a special clutch type designed and developed by RTN.AuxiliaTM substantially saves fuel, fulfils current and upcoming environmental regulations even in restricted areas, lowers main engine maintenance, significantly improves manoeuvring in harbours and workplaces (fundamental for off-shore crafts, tug boats, etc.) and makes noise and vibrations negligent.

    "Technology_Description": "Air Pollution is the world\u2019s worst environmental health risk: 7 million people die every year as a result of air pollution exposure. 2 billion children live in areas where outdoor air pollution exceeds the established thresholds. From an economic point of view, the costs derived from health impacts and mortality from air pollution are increasing every year: in Europe the overall annual economic cost is estimated at \u20ac1,200 billion. Current strategies for improving air quality focuses in control mechanisms but they do not tackle directly the problem of eliminating the pollutants present in the air. The MossTree is a 4 meter-high 3m-wide and 60cm deep, freestanding unit, which contains combi planting of specific moss cultures and vascular plants that eat particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide and ozone \u2013 together offsetting 240 t CO2e/ year. The construction contains smart sensors collecting environmental as well as climatic data, to regulate and control the unit and ensure that the moss culture survives. Thus, the MossTree has the same effect as 275 normal urban trees, but requires 99% less space and 90% less investment. Every MossTree has a capacity to clean the air in a proximity of up to 50m. Thanks to solar panels and rain water retention systems, the unit requires less than 10 hours of maintenance per year. Furthermore, our solution allows digital and visual information transmission through e.g. WiFi, iBeacon and NFC for the purpose of sponsored messages and advertising. Finally, thanks to the sensors incorporated that permanently monitor the air quality the tree will become an important smart city climate infrastructure. After having successfully commercialized the first version of our solution in 9 different cities worldwide, the new version of the MossTree will allow us to obtain a cumulative revenue of \u20ac200 million in the period 2019-2021, open new offices in other UE countries and Asia, and create up to 100 new positions.",

Beyond the ocean monitoring and water management industries, the global pH meter market is expected to reach nearly \u00a31.48 bn by 2022. The pH meter market is segmented into bench top (55% share - \u00a3815m), portable, and continuous pH meters. pHims technology can deliver to all three and has the potential to meet a wide range of needs within the segments; pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, food science (41% share), water and waste treatment, research institutes and environmental control boards. Despite US dominance, in 2014, Europe was the highest revenue generating region at 32% due to the high level of R&D activities, advanced healthcare, and industrial infrastructure. Drivers are new technology (microprocessors for auto temperature and pressure compensation), growing health concerns and regulatory pressure to monitor environmental pollution (waste water pH in industries such as chemicals, pharmaceuticals, food processing) and the need to regulate pH levels (routine testing of soil, water, food, beverage, and dairy products). The objective of this feasibility study is to carry out activities that enable the provision of a comprehensive feasibility report with conclusions, recommendations and a specification of the Phase 2 project objectives, together with a detailed marketing and business plan for the development and commercialisation of pHims.",

The advantages, making this a fundamental step in the ceramic industry, are related to the flowing capacity of the spray-dried granules, permitting the process at high speed and control over the final performances of the products. As a drawback, this is recognized as one of the most energy intensive steps in the ceramic process, due to the massive evaporation of water and the use of compressed air, almost equivalent to the sintering at high temperature. Early results of independent research conducted from DAXEL, in cooperation with a private laboratory in Italy, have brought to the awareness that it can be avoided, through the implementation into a dry-mixing process of fluidizing agents, permitting the granulated powders to reach an equivalent level of fluidity, and therefore enabling equivalent speed of processing. The advantages DAXEL can provide to its ceramic processor customers are the reduction of one energy intensive step, the reduction of capital investments at no modification of the final quality. Technological Feasibility, Market Assessment, Business Models and Plans are the objectives of the DryMix project, oriented to permit the implementation of the project results into real business cases.

The new system, which has been installed and subject to public trials, will optimize the properties of existing piping systems and in turn, serve as reporter element of all incidents occurring in the pipe system and as management tool of parameters commonly used. The solution offer innovative advantages both in terms of the materials used for the pipe and due to the monitoring and traceability possibilities of the embedded sensor system. There is no other similar system in the market, and the cost per meter of the system is lower than \u201cconventional\u201d ones. SME INSTRUMENT Phase 1 will help to define requirements to validate the product in different configurations (dimensions, monitoring functionalities) and uses (drinking water and other fluids), as well as to automate the production process. Through a feasibility study, ABN will measure the potential of the solution in terms of efficiency, business opportunity and compliance with standards, analyze the commercial impact of the device and define the market in concrete and realistic terms, in order to attract investors.

The innovation is based on two new devices: a hydrant tap that maintains the pressure balanced in a building including skyscrapers, and a jet system that breaks water producing an efficient water fog and so temperature decrease 50% faster than with traditional methods, allowing fire-fighters get closer to the fire focus in secure conditions.

    "Technology_Description": "The ski business and mountain economy depend on the randomness of snowfalls. Climate change is shortening the ski season because of less snow precipitation and of higher average winter temperature. Ski resorts have to counteract the lack of natural snow, and to guarantee the opening of ski district in the most touristic periods. Current snowmaking techniques (fans and cannons) require an air temperature below 0\u00b0C and low humidity, thus are not applicable for large part of the season. NeveXN developed a technology able to produce high quality snow at temperatures above 0\u00b0, in all weather condition and without any chemical additives. SnowRESolution is a clean-tech snowmaker that works also when traditional snowmakers cannot be operated. The technology is based on the refrigeration cycle and exploits the triple point of water, a condition that occurs at 0\u00b0C and almost in vacuum (6mbar) at which the three phases of ice, liquid, and vapour are in equilibrium. The compressor is driven by thermal energy that is provided by renewable energy sources, which may be either a solar thermal collector or a biomass steam boiler. Winter tourism is very important in all mountain regions, and risk to undergo to huge losses if slopes are bare. SnowRESolution address the market of ski resorts that want to guarantee the production of snow also when ambient temperature is above 0\u00b0C, enabling an early opening of the ski season. Interest savings opportunities are offered to ski domes that do no need any additional cooling to produce snow and can chose the solar power supply solution.",

    "Technology_Description": "Wind power has established itself in recent years as a clean alternative to conventional sources of electrical generation.Reduced costs and wider deployment, especially in the European market, have led over the past decade to its use at sea. Here, the wind resource is larger and more constant, allowing higher unitary power turbines. However, the marine environment itself also imposes a number of restrictions and challenges. The technology that is being deployed now is fixed to the seabed, using different types of foundations, but a large amount of wind resources is in deeper waters, where floating solutions are needed. Because of their initial higher costs, these solutions are still under development, with only three prototypes installed worldwide. The challenge nowadays is to reduce the costs of floating wind turbine structures that will ease the access to a much larger energy potential than available in land, more easily manageable and with lower visual impact. The aim of the SATH project is the demonstration in real conditions of a floating structure for offshore wind which will allow a reduction in LCOE (Levelized Cost Of Energy) over the current floating technology. To achieve this, it is proposed as a first objective the validation and qualifying for this technology, of a 1:3 scaled prototype not only from a technical point of view but also from economic and necessary logistics. The SATH solution is a platform that consists of two cylindrical floats (of prestressed reinforced concrete) which can be manufactured onshore and transported and positioned at the final location in a single mooring point allowing the rotation of the platform around, self-aligning with the wind direction.",

Through the PUREJUICE project, Energy Pulse Systems (EPS) will validate the implementation of a novel Pulsed Electric Fields (PEF) system within the juice production lines of different fruit matrices: pear, red fruits/berries, tropical fruit, stone fruit and grapes. PUREJUICE constitutes a promising alternative or complement to the standard enzymatic maceration stage for the pre-treatment of raw materials in fruit juice processing. Starting from remarkable results obtained with the EPULSUS technology applied to \u201cnatural\u201d apple juice production within the industrial facility of a global producer, PUREJUICE aims to prove the technological and economic feasibility of the application of the Apple solution to the processing of other fruits. The technological feasibility evaluation will be carried out by analysing the current production process for the selected fruits, followed by the experimental validation of the performances of PUREJUICE with sample batches collected from the customers, and the estimation of the impact of the PUREJUICE implementation on the overall process. In parallel, the economic feasibility study will be focused on ensuring that the PUREJUICE technology represents a sustainable business opportunity for EPS. Our objective is to manufacture and distribute the new system, with the purpose to provide customer companies operating in natural fruit juice processing with a clear competitive edge through the achievement of three main goals: 1) extraction yield increase, 2) enhancement of nutritional/organoleptic properties of processed material, 3) improvement of economic/environmental sustainability of the entire process.",

    "Technology_Description": "ERSO is an Austrian company specialising in the research and development of novel technologies within the energy sector to reduce global energy consumption. Skiing demand has reached almost 400 million visits globally per annum and with over 7000 indoor ice rinks the demand for artificial snow/ice is great. With the rise of global temperatures and the unpredictability of weather conditions the rise in ski resorts limiting the amount of natural snow available, the introduction of artificial snow has been a method of extending the ski season to accommodate further visitors. Some ski resorts in Switzerland, Austria and Italy use artificial snow for 50% or more of their skiing area and the water consumption for this can be up to 20% of an entire regions water usage for a year. Traditional methods of producing artificial snow have a number of disadvantages and environmental effects such as high production costs, short snow lifetime, short temperature range and the damage of the wildlife and fauna. Often, to make good quality snow, water is mixed with either dust or bacteria, of which both can cause damage to the ecosystem when the snow eventually melts. With the huge volumes of water used, the melting process can also lead to instability within the summer season of the ground and can lead to landslides and the destruction of flora. ERSO have identified a business opportunity and have developed technology which restructures the water itself making it more compact and therefore have a longer lifetime which reduces water and energy consumption as well as the environmental effects of artificial snow production. The SnowTech system allows the snow/ice produced to resist melting for up to 30% longer which also means snow can be produced at higher temperatures (up to 2 \u00b0C), reduces costs to ~30%. For a ski resort with 10 km of artificial snow slope we can allow savings of up to 1,000,000 L of water, 160,000 kWh of energy and \u20ac44,000 in cost solely attributed to electricity.",

    "Technology_Description": "Small onshore wind turbines have become increasingly accepted as an alternative to powering many homes, farms and businesses offering on-site electricity generation and increased security of energy supply. However, a number of barriers are preventing wide spread uptake: high cost; performance predictability issues; small wind currently fails to compete with low usage high retail electricity pricing without subsidisation from feed-in tariffs (FiT) or without a very high retail price of electricity. Governments are under immense political pressure to significantly reduce/cut subsidies for renewable technologies, creating a market for small wind which is increasingly unsustainable. To address the need for innovations that overcome principal barriers to small wind, this project seeks to advance Gaia- Wind\u2019s innovative small wind turbine from a prototype demonstrated in a relevant environment (TRL6) to complete and qualified commercial prototype (TRL8). Gaia-Wind\u2019s \u2018FortyForty\u2019 is the first low cost, highly efficient small wind turbine that can compete with the retail price of electricity globally and deliver an excellent ROI for customers, independent of financial subsidy. End-users include farms, rural land owners, investors, communities and rural businesses. Gaia-Wind has an existing and extensive customer base in these markets to ensure rapid roll out. Also targeted towards: residential, commercial and industrial, fish farms, hybrid systems, remote villages, pumping, water desalination and purification, remote monitoring, research and education, telecom base stations hospitals, College/Universities. Study Objectives: Technology and manufacturing process optimisation, market analysis, economic and business assessment, operational capacity analysis. Activities will be delivered within a 6 month period and result in a comprehensive feasibility report detailing the next steps towards development and commercialisation, forming the basis of the SMEI Phase 2 Business Plan.",

IGV will upgrade the protein-rich production in its modern Technological Centre from a current TRL6-7 to TRL9 level. This will be achieved by optimising an innovative combination of extraction and extrusion, which will broaden the European market penetration of our plant-based proteins. Following sustainability aspects of global emerging markets the main application is to upgrade the production of essential aminoacids (EAAs)-enriched, non-soy, gluten- and GMO-free peabased protein flakes and supply them as innovative alternative components to the breakfast cereals, meat surrogates and health-value drinks industries. The products will be produced for a special market: existing and new customers of finished healthy, vegan/vegetarian products for athletes, sportsmen. Our preliminary calculations prove that optimising and upgrading our production capacity will close the gap between the small- and large-scale markets, supporting also other industrial and SME organisations for sustainable growth. The production will be during the first 3 years in one working shift and from year 4 in two working shifts, generating 6-8 new FTEs. This will be detailed in a realistic Business Plan and Commercialisation Strategy in Phase 2. Maximising impact of our products will mean professional Product Management, Marketing and PR, including product and promotional material design, distribution, press-releases, videos, newsletters and articles. Market penetration of our vegetal proteins will be facilitated by thematic workshops, application trials with farmers, food processors, consumers. We intend besides penetrating niche markets, also to extend our market share with support of Coaching Actions, own resources and Venture Capital of EU as well.",

    "Technology_Description": "Delacon is a pioneer and worldwide market leader of phytogenic (plant-derived natural products) feed additives for livestock. Delacon\u2019s objective with the PHESPA project is to develop and market a transversal nutritional solution based in phytogenics to counteract the detrimental effects of heat stress in farm animals. Heat stress is a critical problem for livestock when a high environmental temperature is accompanied by high humidity. Heat stress in the summer months has been estimated to cause huge economic loses to the farming industry in Europe, especially in the Mediterranean countries. Current solutions to heat stress in livestock include energy-consuming air conditioning, ventilation or sprinkling the animals and pens with water. Delacon proposes an innovative approach to mitigate heat stress with the development of nutritional solutions which improve productivity, are all plant-derived, sustainable, and safe. The R&D team of Delacon has identified 3 substances that were screened in vitro and verified in a relevant environment with broilers. By effectively reducing the effects of heat stress, the animals\u2019 immune system is supported and the risk of infections is reduced. The creation of an effective heat-stress prevention product line thus positively influences food safety, via improvement of animal product quality.  The heat-stress prevention product will increase the sustainability of animal production in Europe and globally. The main users will be integrators (feed mills and farmers) that have the entire production chain under control, and they will benefit from improvements in every part of the cycle. With the PHESPA project the technological and economic feasibility of the product, its commercial potential, its future market acceptance and impact, profitability and opportunities in the European and the global markets will be evaluated.",

The project will also address the commercial exploitation in the precision farming market. Currently the majority of farmers overuse fertilizers and pesticide on calendar basis without taking into account the land characteristics or the extension of pest and disease. This imply additional cost and great environmental impact. Agriculus DSS is a cloud-based system able to collect, analyse and process multiple data coming from on the field remote sensing (IOT), drones and satellite to guide farming decisions. Thank to innovative algorithms, developed under the previous research project SIG 2015 by Teamdev in close cooperation with the University of Perugia, Agricolus DSS is expected to dramatically improve the performance of already existing precision farming solutions.  Compared to competitors it will reduce over fertilization by 12- 22%, increase farm productivity by 5-10%, mitigate the environmental impact and reduce the disease risk up to 20% (Olive Fruit Fly and Phytophthora). Farmers will save up to 10000\u20ac per year. Precision Farming market is EUR 2.3 bn in 2014 and is expected to grow with a Compound annual growth of 12% through 2020.The global market for precision farming had achieved a volume of 2.3 billion EUR by the end of 2014 \u2013 on an upward trend. The estimated market potential for Agriculus DSS is about 21 million euro and we estimate to hire six high skilled employees. The feasibility study comprises an investigation of market structures, segments and barriers, a customer survey and product validation, the identification of key commercial partners and three pilot trials and the development of an IP strategy. Agricolus DSS helps to respect the EU CAP contributing to Europe\u2019s agricultural competitiveness and sustainability.",

The StemSense sensor is the world's first to deliver accurate measurements of stem water potential and relay to farmers exact quantities of water required and when. The sensor is embedded in the trunk of the plant and information sent via a communication box to the farmers. Farmers using the StemSense sensor experience up to 20% higher income, significant water savings and reduced costs. The patented technology has been engineered for use in fruit trees and successfully tested on citrus and peach trees. Within the overall project, Saturas intends to optimise the communication and control interface to reflect real-time stem water potential levels; manufacture 300 sensors for test sites; undertake full scale tests of the StemSense sensor systems in Israel, Italy and Spain; and engineer a miniaturized version of the StemSense sensor to fit grapevines.",

    "Technology_Description": "Salmonella species (also called serovars) are important zoonotic pathogens that cause gastrointestinal disease in humans and animals. Poultry products contaminated with these pathogens are one of the major sources of human Salmonella infections worldwide. Salmonella Enteritidis and Typhimurium are the serovars most frequently associated with human food poisoning (78.3 % of all cases in 2003). The serovars of Salmonella having places three to five are Virchow, Infantis and Hadar. Vaccination of chickens, along with other intervention measures in the overall biosecurity system of chicken farms, is an important strategy that is currently being used to reduce the levels of Salmonella in poultry flocks, which will ultimately lead to lower rates of human infections. However, despite numerous studies that have been performed, there is still a need for safer, well-defined Salmonella vaccines. At Immunolab we invented SAL ETHVI \u2013 innovative vaccine against above listed 5 serovars of Salmonella. We also breakthrough the technology for the vaccine production in a way that allows any configuration of serotypes, therefore if there is a need for a vaccine against another serovar, its production will be very easy. The end users of the vaccine will be poultry breeders, namely hens and broilers flocks owners. The unique features of our vaccine constituting our competitive adventage comprise : (1) easy application ; (2) low price ; (3) immediate vaccination upon hatching; (4) no risk of bacteria activation and spreading. We have filled a patent application for the technology and upon the vaccine registration and certification, we aim to commercialize it at the broilers markets of the biggest European poultry meat producers: Poland, Germany, France, the Netherlands, United Kingdom and Russia. We are applying for the SME Instrument Phase 1, aiming to complete the feasibility study and a business plan including industry value-chain mapping, market sizing and critical risks assessment.",

    "Technology_Description": "Currently, the bioplastics industry is restricted by the high cost of PHA and PHB bioplastics, despite the global capacity for their production outstripping commonly-used hydrocarbon-based thermoplastics and alternative bioplastic solutions; contemporary bioplastics that can compete with hydrocarbon thermoplastics are derived from crops (primarily using starch compounds), creating a conflict between using crops for food or as an industrial raw material, and increasing the cost of food. Furthermore, wastewater presents itself as a constant burden for industry, particularly wastewater containing nutrients that can potentially lead to a high biological oxygen demand (BOD) which damages aquatic ecosystems. The Eggplant is an innovative two-phase water treatment procedure that filters industrial wastewater and applies a three-stage post-filtration process. Through this process, each Eggplant uses wastewater as a raw material for the production of bioplastics using a commercial bacterial culture. Critically, the water at the end of the process is purified and safe to be used as drinking water or for release into watercourses. The primary value of Eggplant is the reduction of waste from agri-food industrial wastewater from twofold to zero \u2013 filtration removes the majority of pollutants and fermentation removes organic contaminants. The resulting concentrate is then processed into PHA and PHB bioplastics. Moreover, an Eggplant, through the use of concentrated substrate can generate 3-4 times as much bioplastic from an equivalent volume of wastewater.",

At InstaGreen our goal is to bring the point of production back to the point of consumption, shorten the supply chain & drastically reduce the carbon footprint by reducing the resources used & waste produced in the growing, processing & transportation of produce. We developed a proprietary food-on-demand service, initially targeting high end restaurants. After extensive research & development we created a scalable growing system using aeroponic technology & currently have a second generation prototype of the InstaGreen system (InstaGrow unit & GrowCartridges) at TRL6. Our business model focuses on the service rather than the product: we grow the leafy greens in centralised urban locations, once the greens are ready we deliver the living plants to the client\u2019s premises, where the cartridge is placed in our InstaGrow unit. The greens are ready for consumption without the need for cleaning & can be harvested whenever as needed. Our primary goals for the SMEI are to confirm our market assumptions, perform an in-depth market analysis, confirm willingness to pay & develop a full feasibility study for European roll-out. Aeroponics is a new technology that is only recently starting to reach the market. We are initially targeting a niche market: High end restaurants with chefs that are interested in ecologically responsible, high quality organic food. After creating a critical mass in B2B market, we can start a B2C offering. This strategy has been validated by Ogilvy & Mather. We will target big cities that have a strong food culture as well as those that are in climates that make it difficult to have fresh produce year round. As it is a food-on-demand-service, food is supplied on a subscription basis. The InstaGrow unit is leased 20\u20ac/mo, the GrowCartridges are sold for 15\u20ac/2 new cartridge. This ensures steady/recurring revenues. We predict an income 9.302.475 \u20ac by 2022.",

Energy analysts have predicted that, if a viable and cost effective technology can be delivered, the deep-water offshore wind market in Europe could meet 50% of Europe\u2019s electricity requirement by 2050. Unlike competitor technologies the simple scalable \"Starfloat\" is designed for construction at existing shipbuilding facilities with restricted water depth thus opening up construction opportunities for European shipyards that are currently in decline. The innovative floating foundation design and assembly process takes significant cost out of the CAPEX of deep water floating offshore wind projects and removes the need for risky offshore marine operations. \"Starfloat\" therefore has the potential to be disruptive to the current perceived limitations of the offshore wind industry by bring floating offshore wind into the same levelised cost of energy (LCOE) as fixed foundation offshore wind. This will allow the project financing of deeper water wind farm sites, where the wind resource is stronger and more reliable, to be exploited using relatively low risk technology with the end result of reducing carbon emissions and reduced dependency for Europe on imported fuels. It also has the benefit of bringing steel fabrication work to declining shipyards and assembly work to deep-water offshore construction sites that are currently seeing a sharp decline in activity with the fall in the oil price and the collapse of the new shipbuilding market.\"",

In order to resolve these problems and to achieve the objectives of the European Water Framework 2000/60/EC on improving water quality, OKO-tech has developed the method OKO-CPB 4.0 for treating industrial wastewaters which is unique worldwide. A holistic and sustainable concept for treating industrial wastewaters is put into effect here for the first time. Energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions are reduced by more than 90 % compared to the conventional methods in an average treatment plant, which corresponds to the annual electricity consumption of 900 single-family homes. The achieved water quality allows both reuse and direct discharge into water bodies. There is a strong demand in Germany alone, as for about 21,000 treatment plants for industrial wastewater - treatment volume about 2.1 billion m\u00b3/a - a retrofit is required in the short and medium term. Thus, industrial enterprises and waste recyclers throughout Europe can use a method that implements the 2000/60/EC requirements and reduces energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions at the same time \u2013 a major contribution to climate protection. On a global scale, the world\u2019s rising industrial demand of water can be covered by water reuse only.

The objectives are: final technical development, product demonstration through field trials with six pilot customers, market launch in five selected EU countries and market replication leading to a turnover of 28 m \u20ac within 5 years after launch. Today, most farmers manage their crop by gut feeling, leading to inappropriate fertilization, plant damage and unnecessary environmental impact. AgriCloud is the first holistic FP approach, processing all available data from agronomic sensors, machinery and service companies and, backed by plant nutrition expert knowledge, facilitates a targeted use of fertilisers and herbicides, efficient machinery utilisation and workflow management. Farmers are operating a mixed stock of stand-alone agricultural machinery. AgriCloud meets their need for integrated solutions with only one data infrastructure for a coordinated, easy-to-use machinery control from one user interface. By using AgriCloud, they will increase yield production between 3-10%, reduce lodging to 50-100%, reduce fertilisers by 12-20% and improve harvest efficiency by 12-20%. Their annual savings amount to approx. 130\u20ac/ha, which enables amortization of the AgriCloud invest within 1-1.5 years. The EU agricultural industry faces the challenge of responding to an increasing demand for food whilst at the same time having to ensure the sustainable use of resources. The Commission already identified PF as a key technology to solve this problem. However, European farmers have not yet adopted PF due to draw backs of existing solutions. AgriCloud is able to solve those bottlenecks and contributes to Europe\u2019s drive towards more competitiveness and long-term sustainability in agriculture as well as towards the recent EU Common Agriculture Policy (CAP).",

End result, more food and energy security, a theme underscored by Horizon 2020.Sea-More-Yield represents an excellent opportunity for the H2020 SME instrument as it will launch the participating SME Brandon Products into new markets, promote growth, and create high returns of investment. Sea-More-Yield is aligned with the call topic supporting SMEs efforts for the development - deployment and market replication of innovative biotechnology solutions for blue growth. Sea-More-Yield is a perfect example of such an opportunity. The basis of the Sea-More-Yield technology is the seaweed bioresource used in biostimulant manufacture, which is a complex and unique resource whose chemical, biochemical and biological properties provides major undiscovered potential. The main beneficiaries of the development of Sea-More-Yield will be Brandon Products; Growers of OSR gain from increased net margins, increased yield, increased quality premiums; Oil processors will have a larger quantity of high quality oil; Product distributors will have a disruptive technology with a proven mode of action; Consumers will benefit from a predictable harvest = predictable production costs = more stable pricing; The environment less agrochemicals, fertiliser more biofuel and leading to more sustainable biofuel production.",

    "Technology_Description": "Both regulations and costumer needs resulted in expansion of the market for green labelled food products cultivated at sustainable way. Nevertheless, the availability of affordable technological tools for the production of green vegetables is limited. Furthermore vegetable suppliers (in Europe typically farmers with small land) neither have the essential technological knowledge nor the willingness to change the cultivation methods. Realizing these trends, Vegetable Trading Centre (VTC), a regional market leader of Vegetable production and trading, and Multisense, a technology intensive start-up, put together this proposal, aiming at the establishment of a sustainable agricultural eco-system. An innovative technology for on-site production of microalgae and their usage as bio-fertilizer in vegetable cultivation has been piloted at VTC. In the proposed business model, this technology will be sold to framers helping them to make microalgae based fertilizer on their own land at cost-effective eco-friendly way. The trader (Vegetable Trading Center) guarantees to buy the vegetables produced this eco-conscious way and bring them to superstores at high price. In this phase 2 proposal we target to upgrade and generalize the pilot site to a commercial technology, obtaining upgraded sensor and control system, make generalized designs, user manuals and descriptions, use cases, as well as demonstrate the efficiency in extensive field trials. Furthermore, starting with the suppliers of VTC, we aim at expand our business model to Europe and carry out the early marketing actions within the project.",

    "Technology_Description": "ACIES BIO has developed an innovative and disruptive high-value technology to address a major economical and environmental challenge of the world\u2019s dairy industry: waste whey. Over 200 million tons of whey is generated annually, and only limited economical solutions exist to process it. The innovative patent pending technology Whey2Value uses a unique bioprocess to utilize whey as a primary ingredient for microbial fermentation to produce sustainable high-value products, such as vitamin B12. The technology greatly reduces the negative impact on the environment by almost eliminating the organic content of the wastewater, allowing for its recycling, while the product of the technology is a protein-rich biomass with high content of vitamin B12 to be used as a very high quality animal feed to complete the dairy industry\u2019s circle. The innovation W2V is perfect example of how circular economy should work. The Whey2Value technology requires a very low-cost processing facility, which can be installed on site, and minimal maintenance costs. It represents a truly unique opportunity to create a huge and disruptive impact on dairy industry, particularly for the competitiveness of small and medium sized European dairy companies, generating high-value products from waste material, and at the same time creating a sustainable solution with a greatly reduced burden to the environment. The objective of this project proposal is to prepare a thorough business plan and feasibility study in the scope of Phase 1, followed by scaling-up and demonstration of operational technology in industrial setting with a local dairy company in the scope of Phase 2. The technology is ready for industrial demonstration, which will be followed by EU and global commercialization of Whey2Value. We expect a rapid worldwide market adoption of this disruptive eco-biotechnology.",

The low-temperature (Lt-AD) process provides a novel solution to Food and Drinks industrial sectors producing large WW volumes requiring treatment. The sector of interest is milk treatment and processing, a growing market producing over 367 billion litres annually; WW is typically treated using conventional aerobic processes resulting in high sludge yields, requiring a large footprint on-site and a heavy reliance on fossil fuels. Lt-AD produces negligible sludge volumes, has a compact design, requires no heat input or biogas recirculation, and produces effluent of urban wastewater directive (UWWD) standard (< 125 mg/L COD) without post-aeration. A typical dairy processing plant producing 5,000 m3 WW per day can save 97% on operational costs by replacing aerobic treatment with Lt-AD, and generate annual biogas revenue of \u20ac616,266. The technology's low temperature operation allows for 100% of the biogas produced being available for reuse or resale. The process also has a high impact on environmental savings through reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, lowered thermal energy and fossil fuels requirements. ",

Irrigation practices put more and more pressure on scarce freshwater resources and mineral fertilizers are often overused leading to environmental problems and heavy impacts on the production costs of producers. Increasing resource efficiency, productivity and competitiveness of agricultural practitioners are crucial for addressing the aforementioned societal challenges. Fertigation, a novel concept merging irrigation and fertilization to one process, poses an innovative alternative to conventional cultivation practices. Hydro-Air, as SME in irrigation technology development and provision, developed and integrated the concept of fertigation with pivot- and linear irrigation systems. Using GPS & GIS data in conjunction with sensor based soil and crop property parameters the SMART Fertigation system enables sub area specific farmland management and fertigation. Optimised resource application leads to an immense savings potential in production costs (water & fertilizer by 20%) besides increasing crop yield from growth phase adjusted water and nutrient supply. This \u2018saving & gaining\u2019 makes Hydro-Air confident to supply an internationally growing market demand for resource efficient, green technologies. Based on encouraging results in field trials Hydro-Air prepares advances towards market introduction. Hydro-Air will apply and use the funding in Phase 1 to conduct a feasibility study which will reveal the European market potential of SMART Fertigation. Client groups in targeted countries will be evaluated and a business plan will developed considering estimated costs and revenues including return of investment schemes. The results and experiences will feed into the continuous improvement of the SMART Fertigation system preparing for subsequent development phases.",

    "Technology_Description": "Sea-More-Yield is a revolutionary non-transgenic platform for trait introduction via single 1.5L/Ha foliar spray, enabling immediate expression of desirable anti-shatter traits in OSR. This pioneering technology enables growers for the first time to modulate OSR pod physiology to minimise seed loss and yield risk with an early season spray (in the absence of pods). With a global population set to reach 9 billion by 2050, OSR is a key crop for human and animal consumption and is central to mitigating a future food and/or energy security crisis. OSR due to its relatively recent domestication suffers from a number of defects which limits its success as a modern day crop. Fully mature pods of oilseed rape are extremely prone to opening, resulting in seed loss (pod shatter). Typical losses vary between 15% and 25% of the potential yield, but reductions of up to 50% were estimated in seasons when weather conditions were poor prior to and during harvest. A reduction in the tendency of pods to opening is the number one trait sought by farmers and would serve to increase the proportion of the yield recovered by the combine harvester and thereby improve production efficiency and sustainability of OSR as alternative food and energy source. To address this industry-limiting problem, SMY offers a unique blue technology that modulates OSR pod physiology to control unsynchronized pod shatter leading to recovery of an additional 20% of the yield potential.",

    "Technology_Description": "No need for heat! NVP Energy presents the first to market, high-rate AD technology that successfully treats low strength wastewater (WW) at ambient temperatures (4 - 20\u00b0C). The low-temperature anaerobic digestion (Lt-AD) process provides a novel solution to Food and Drinks industrial sectors which produce large volumes of WW. The European milk treatment and processing sector alone generates over 367 billion litres annually which is typically treated using conventional aerobic processes. The latter treatment process is unsustainable. It results in high sludge yields, requires a large footprint on-site and is hugely reliant on fossil fuels for aeration. The Lt-AD technology produces negligible sludge volumes, presents a compact design, requires no heat input or biogas recirculation, and produces effluent of urban wastewater directive (UWWD) standard (< 125 mg/L COD) without post-aeration. Comparing Lt-AD to conventional aerobic treatment of WW from a typical dairy processing plant producing 2,000 m3 WW per day, Lt-AD can provide annual OPEX savings of \u20ac1,662,106 p.a over a payback period of 2.49 years that includes RHI revenue of \u20ac374,176. The low temperature operation of Lt-AD allows for 100% of the biogas produced being available for reuse or resale. Lt-AD also has a high impact on environmental savings through reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and lowered thermal energy and fossil fuels requirements.  This Phase 2 project will allow NVP Energy install and commission a demonstrator plant and gain 8-12 months operational data. The results obtained, in conjunction with ETV assessment, will build the business case for each targeted market channel ahead of commercialisation. Other key project objectives include: commercialisation partner relationship development; promotional materials development; exploitation planned; assessment and protection of IP assets and project risk management.",

The ease-of-use CryoProduct meets the nutritional requirements of fish larvae. A doubling in growth rate and a 25-30% shortening of the live feed period compared to a diet of the suboptimal live feed diets commonly used at marine hatcheries have been demonstrated (large-scale industrial trial, TRL6). With a well-functioning feeding protocol to be developed in the project period, it is expected that performances of the fish larvae will be even better. It will be put effort on optimizing the cryopreservation protocols to achieve a CryoProduct with even better quality than today for improving the performances of fish juveniles. A bio-security evaluation will be performed, and a screening of microorganisms will be needed for the registration of the CryoProduct. To successfully launch the CryoProduct into the EU market, it will be of major importance to scale up the production, to establish efficient logistic systems, identify end-users needs and to provide a reliable commercialisation plan for the best possible market introduction. As the CryoProduct has outstanding performances compared to today\u2019s alternatives, we expect a market share of 50% of the live feed market on a longer term. This corresponds to a revenue of more than 100 million \u20ac. As the market grows 3-4% per year, the market size will double in about 20 years. It is a considerable aquaculture production in the EU. If the product meet the expectations, it will most probably be a major contribution to realize the production potential of marine fish in aquaculture in the EU.

Already today, Europe\u2019s Mediterranean regions suffer from water scarcity and thereof foremost the food sector, accounting for 80% of freshwater demand while representing a decisive economic factor in that regions. Depending strongly on secure and sustainable water supply, green technologies for water treatment are needed to safeguard its economic prosperity. Against this background WTS has developed an innovative, energy-efficient and sustainable technology for decentralised seawater desalination to generate high-quality potable water cost-efficiently (by using special high performance heat exchanger technology) and environmentally-friendly (using waste heat as energy input and avoiding salt pollution). The system provided in a sea container is portable and easily scalable imitating a weather-like cycle. The WTS solution is advantageous related to state of the art technology w.r.t. energy use, environmental burden and costs. The key market application is decentralized water production for users or user groups with the need to consume water directly on site but face limitation on available freshwater resources (due to large distances or over-exploitation). The idea is to offer small-scale, distributed desalination for the extraction of raw water from saline water sources for 1) drinking water production and 2) process water production. It will be viable to use the WTS technology in Mediterranean coastal areas and islands. The global capacity of desalination plants is expected to grow with a CAGR of 11%. The project helps safeguard sustainability and secure food production in the Mediterranean countries and other water stressed regions.

A green wall is a wall covered with greenery that includes a water delivery system and a growing medium. The Naturbo process happens here, in the growth medium, where the plants\u2019 roots are located. NaturVention has designed an active green wall that exploits the Naturbo technology absorbing the air impurities in the root zone of the plants to transform them by breaking them down into nutrients for the plants. This enables the replacement of the synthetic chemicals and microbes in the indoor air with nature\u2019s own healthy chemicals. A Naturbo-powered green wall provides offices, schools, hospitals and many other indoor facilities, with the best possible indoor air quality. The effectiveness of this process is amazing: e.g., one single Naturbo green wall device has the air cleaning capacity of over 8000 houseplants, naturalizing a space the size of an average classroom. No ordinary green wall is capable of doing the same. Artificial intelligence remotely controls the Naturbo\u2019s operation and its environment via remote connection to a cloud server. Thus, Naturbo\u2019s functions are constantly adjustable when conditions like temperature or seasons change. This way, people in the space always have the best possible indoor air quality: the fresh and healthy air of the virgin Finnish forests is brought to thousands European city dwellers.",

    "Technology_Description": "The project intends to explore the feasibility of introducing to the market Sea Litter Critters, a compact, unmanned, renewables-powered and self sufficient marine litter collection and treatment vessel based on a patent pending device treating waste thermally with plasma technology and no harmful emissions. This device is designed to operate near the shores especially nearer tourist facilities substituting the mechanical collection of litter currently adopted. By picking up litter (plastic debris mostly) near the point of entry, Sea Litter Critters contribute to minimising the pollution risks linked to plastic in the sea, where plastic items become brittle and break down into small particles, but basically never dissolve. Such particles can be eaten by zooplankton thus enter the foodchain. Therefore picking up plastic debris while still intact and as soon as possible after their disposal supports and complement in the short term all the high level policy actions for litter prevention (minimisation of waste, use of biodegradable plastic, awareness raising, beach clean up days etc.). This study aims to check the attractiveness of the innovation to the market involving potential customers (coast towns, associations of tourist and fishing ports and marinas, representatives from the cruise and hotels industry, marine natural reserves authorities). The first markets identified are on the Mediterranean Sea, which is at the center of a very highly populated area of the World with many Countries relying mostly on tourism. Studies confirm that the Med has mostly marine litter derived from this economic activity and up to 80% of it originating from land. Italy, with its over 7600km long coastline and a strong dependency upon tourism, will be the first market, followed suit by France and Croatia and then Spain and Greece. After a 3 year phase to cover development, industrialisation and commercialisation, production is expected to start in 2019, with employment of 17 new staff.",

In a context exacerbated by the ongoing climate change, which results in farmers\u2019 increasing need to irrigate cost-efficiently to stay competitive, policy makers around the globe are striving to implement strategies and new technologies for better use and conservation of water resources. However, while the introduction of new drip and sprinkler-based irrigation practices allowed substantial water savings, these came at the expenses of an increase of energy consumption and capital expenditure, making modernized irrigation less profitable. Leveraging on the successful launch of the Barsha Pump, a floating river pump for small-scale farmers throughout the world, which does not require any fuel, electricity to operate, aQysta will develop and demonstrate a large-scale system for canals (with a power of 1.5 kW, compared to 150 W for floating river pumps) that can serve the needs of irrigation communities in Europe. This will be achieved by integrating the patent-pending Barsha Pump with the Hydrostatic Pressure Wheel concept, which is up to 90% efficient, compared to only 29.6% maximum efficiency of floating waterwheels and has been successfully proven as a prototype in both lab conditions and in field. This novel HyPump system will be designed as a size-scalable concept, allowing for several variants according to the specific needs of the targeted customers in Europe, and will allow users to benefit from up to 6-times increase in agricultural yield (compared to rain-fed irrigation) and up to 70% savings on operating costs with respect to standard fuel or electric pumps.

Our idea is to use a relatively new technology called \u2018implosion\u2019 to selectively break down and separate non-metallic components of slag from metallic particles.

The vessel\u2019s design has the optimum on-board capacity to carry up to three people, and designated space specifically created for the cargo of detection equipment, sensors and other kit. Introducing patented technology, Scubacraft will become the state of the art technology for use in underwater industrial applications for the energy industry sector, specifically offshore inspections for wind turbines. The applicability of Scubacraft can also be adopted for marine conservation and search and rescue operations. The current state-of-the-art method for performing underwater inspections uses divers to manually carry equipment to the inspection site and then perform the inspection. Scubacraft can revolutionise this way of inspecting by transporting a team of divers and equipment directly to the inspection site quicker, thereby creating a larger window of opportunity for the inspection to be performed, maximising inspection efficiencies and enabling earlier defect detection of structural integrities.",

With sharpening regulations, environmental concerns, and the need for sustainable practices to ensure continued agriculture and food supply, the market is witnessing increased demand for safe and sustainable biocidal agents, while maintaining demanding requirements in cost, scalability, and availability. HPGen is a disruptive technology product, enabling for the first time on-demand, cost-effective production of hydrogen peroxide - an eco-friendly biocide and oxygenator, directly at the point of use, using only water, air and electricity as feedstock ! HPGen is set to displace presently used, increasingly regulated toxic chemical products in agriculture, and in turn in livestock sectors. By doing so, HPNow will address EU objectives in improved food and water safety, increased crop yields, and reduction of environmental impact, transport and handling of toxic agri-chemical agents. Implementing HPGen at agriculture and livestock farms in the EU and globally will substantially reduce direct and indirect biocide costs, and create a > EUR 2 billion market opportunity across the value chain. HPGen is being developed, and will be brought to market, by HPNow ApS, a Danish SME. The company has already attracted the attention and collaboration of multinational industry players, including an EU-based global leader in hydrogen peroxide production, three of the world\u2019s leading micro irrigation companies, and one of the EU's largest specialty meat producers. These global firms will be contributing resources and knowhow to the project at their own cost, with their interest in later serving as HPGen channel partners - a key to our company's scalable go-to-market strategy. In Phase I commercial, technical, and production activities related to HPGen market introduction will be analyzed, and a comprehensive business plan will result.",

At present different techniques are needed to inspect the ballast, track substructure and tunnels. TRACKSCAN would undertake these activities and more through non-invasive inspection. Within Europe ballast inspection requires digging a trench or driving plastic lined steel tubes into ballast with a pneumatic hammer. This is obviously impractical, time consuming, labour intensive and can miss ballast fouling. TRACKSCAN inspects all ballast so that maintenance can be targeted and effective. The feasibility study proposed intends to verify the technological and practical aspects of the system and ensure the business concept is sound. The system is described in terms of what can be achieved the science behind it is retained as confidential, as permitted by the call. The penetrating radar system has a rotating antenna which allows 360 degrees inspection and in any plane, this means that unlike other ballast inspection systems in the US, the TRACKSCAN system can extend beyond the vehicle width. The TRACKSCAN system is innovative, unique and we believe has a large market potential. The areas of inspection include: ballast; sub-ballast including drainage systems; water pipes and utilities, tunnel linings and tunnel track systems and bridge surface structures.",

    "Technology_Description": "Water is used in almost all ceramic processes. The production cycle of porcelain stoneware in particular, as all wet production cycles, uses large quantities of water and generates considerable quantities of sludge. Currently, a line that processes 1.000.000 sq/m of tiles per year requires approximately 113.000.000 litres of water and generates sludge that contains more than 600 tons of abraded dust. It is estimated that the European ceramics industry, to produce approximately 1.300 million sqm of tiles, consumes more than 30.000 million cube meters of water, compared to the 8 million used by a city of approximately 300,000 inhabitants. In addition, the market demand in ceramic sector requires more and more products to have high intrinsic technical characteristics (reduced absorption, high surface hardness, abrasion resistance) that are typical of porcelain stoneware. These features are obtained through mechanical finishing treatment (polishing and lapping) of fired tiles. Unfortunately, there is a negative side to machining surfaces after firing: it implies the use of a considerable amount of water and generates and equally large amount of sludge. This generates waste, which in addition to material removed, also contains process water.",

    "Technology_Description": "In long-term, cocoa production is faced with serious challenges. Changing weather conditions, low and decreasing yields, ageing cocoa farmers, competition with other cash crops, volatile prices and pest-related diseases are threatening the future supply of cocoa. Around 4 million tonnes of cocoa beans are required each year just to keep up with current demand. About 500 million new cocoa plants (5%) are required each year. With demand for cocoa on the rise, cocoa production is set to receive special attention in the next few years. Micropropagation has emerged as an important global agro-technology routinely used for rapid generation of high quality, uniform and disease-free planting material. Boereboom Invitro Portugal is a SME specialized in in vitro plant micropropagation that will be pioneer in in vitro cocoa plants micropropagation worldwide, aiming at enhancing profitability and growth performance through innovative and competitive products seizing Europe and global markets opportunities. The SME can answer the increase on demand by presenting a maximum production capacity of 1 million cocoa plants and a net profit of \u20ac600,000, enable a corporate growth of a total net profit of \u20ac1,200 million by 2020. Boereboom already has a two years agreement with Theobroma, to whom will sell the product initially. Nowadays, the main commercial available solution for cocoa propagation is seedling. In vitro micropropagation offers several advantages over seed propagation, resulting in reduced costs, improved market access and sustainable increases of consumption. A competing solution to Boereboom\u2019s product is cocoa plant propagation by somatic embryogenesis. However the application of this method is still in a development phase. Boereboom\u2019s team has the relevant know-how to implement the business, having created a project management structure that can ensure a competent management and a solid integration and communication throughout the whole project lifecycle.",

The olive fruit fly (Batrocea oleae) is considered the most devastating insect pest of olives in the world, being known in the Mediterranean region for over 2000 years and having reached every other olive oil production area throughout the time. It affects the most important competitiveness factor for this culture, the fruit quality, for both table olive and olive oil production, even with low infestation levels. All solutions developed until now have not achieved an optimal performance of the treatment together with no environmental side-effects and low cost for farmers. This is precisely the aim of DACUSNEX COMBI, a product joining the action of semiochemicals (a pheromone or other chemical that conveys a signal from one organism to another so as to modify the behaviour of the recipient organism) and specific traps. It has been already developed and tested in more than 6,000 ha of olive cultivation with perfect performance results, environmental soundness and a low cost, improving the performance of current options. The company, ECONEX, has been working for more than 25 years in the development of biocontrol solutions and is now facing the development of world commercialization of this product. To do that, the company needs to prepare for a fast and wide market uptake and to solve production constraints, finish the IP issues and develop the final commercial kit. Currently, the company has more than 8,000 customers in 27 countries and has 30 delegations in 11 different countries. With DACUSNEX COMBI, ECONEX expects to become the world leader in the control of the olive fruit fly.",

    "Technology_Description": "Aquaculture has done reasonably well to supplement the expanding consumption of fish and seafood in the EU but has still been unable to have the desired impact because of the high set up, operating and maintenance costs; lack of space along the coastal shores; pollution and threats of diseases and eutrophication. Hence, we developed SubCage \u2013 a working proof of concept prototype to TRL 6 which is based on a patented Tension Leg Cage (TLC) technology capable of submerging fish cages to depths of up to 55 m at a controlled velocity based on the principle of wave ispersion. This prototype is a 12 m diameter fully submersible fish cage, which has been tested for 2 years in Crete using red porgy. This was successfully demonstrated as there were no issues during the operation and thus confirmed that SubCage satisfies all customer needs, such as: cost benefit solution for fish farming in unsheltered area; increase of fish quality; improvement of fish health and mortality rate. Despite the risk surrounding aquaculture in the unsheltered regions due to its environment; we proved that, by using SubCage, expanding production capabilities in such areas is feasible, commercially beneficial to farmers and can increase the value of the fish species. With the help of the SME instrument in scaling up our prototype to a 30-55 m diameter commercially acceptable fish cage, we would expect to contribute to an increase in fish price of up to 20% and additional increase in yield of up to 2% in comparison with surface cages. In comparison with competitor technologies, our prices will be several times lower by 30-40% as well as an estimated ROI being achievable in approximately 3 years. Within 5 years, we can humbly anticipate to enhance the production capacity of the EU by 2%. This translates to Refa Med Srl. deploying 402 SubCage units in the EU within 5 years, generating a revenue stream of over \u20ac80 million and helping create between 300 and 400 product-related full-time jobs.",

In order to overcome these issues, Biocurve and Quintin have developed a cutting edge biomass boiler capable of working under condensing conditions. Thanks to a novel spiral heat exchanger that enhances 50% the exchange surface, C-Heat compact solution shows > 100% energy efficiency by capturing almost all latent heat of condensation of water vapor in the exhaust stream. In addition, an accurate control of the system enables low temperature applications (i.e. radiant floors). Until now, C-Heat has passed rigorous technical assessments, procuring international quality standards certifications. Also, several units are well operating in real condition, installed in private apartments since 2013. Therefore, an appropriate technology readiness level together with the unmet needs invite us to establish an ambitious but achievable aim for the next years: To become an international reference in the bio heating domestic and tertiary segments as well as the small scale industry. In fact, it does lead us to believe that C-Heat is potentially the best solution for the appointed market niches, if we notice its competitive price and its unique features.",

Europe, with 3 of its countries (France, Germany and The Netherlands) as three of the top four seed exporters in the world includes nearly 7,200 seed companies and more than 50,000 employees. Production of high quality seeds can increase crop yield by 15-20%. Seed moisture content needs to be controlled to ensure high germination rates, thus high quality seeds. An optimum drying process with control of air\u2019s relative humidity and temperature is needed to ensure harvested seed is at safe moisture content before storage or other purposes. Existing drying and cooling methods for seeds lack of control of these parameters, are not energy efficient and require high investment from farmers. Moreover, seed drying is one of the most energy consuming processes on farms, consuming as much energy as all field works together. With an efficient seed drying process, savings for farmers could be more than 50%. DryCoolerSeeds is able to dry and cool the seeds in a continuous monitored process with adaptation to climate variations, saving energy (99% of energy saved), time (2.5 less time needed than traditional dryers), ensuring the correct moisture content and temperature of seeds, resulting therefore in high quality seeds. Marcold\u2019s technology is a step further in automation, simplification and costs savings (>60% compared to mix flow drying) being able to incorporate two different functions (drying and cooling) in a single machine surpassing the competition in the current market. The aim of the project is to build and demonstrate in real end user\u2019s facilities our DryCoolerSeeds prototype adjusting the working parameters for effective conservation of seeds while ensuring a successful commercialization of the technology in Europe and Latin America that will drive Marcold into an exponential growth.",

Compsule aims to contribute to reduce the amount of recyclable material being sent to landfills as a result of the increased use of capsuled coffee. In Italy alone over 1 billion plastic coffee capsules are consumed annually. Albeit being made of 100% recyclable materials, coffee capsules are barely recycled due to the time and effort required in cleaning and sorting the capsule\u2019s components after use. Point Plastics have developed an innovative chemical additive that when mixed with bioplastics increases their thermal stability, making them compatible for extreme operational applications such as espresso coffee extraction. This process technology has a great impact on biobased polymer producers enabling a wider market share in fields impossible to target today. Compsules will be able to be disposed of with other food and green waste that is commonly collected by municipalities within the European Union, thus reducing the amount of waste being sent to landfills by hundreds of thousands of tonnes per year. For coffee producers the capsules will reduce their carbon footprint and respond to the demand of an increasingly environmentally conscious consumer base. For the capsule printing manufacturers, the Compsule does not impose any new machinery on their current production line as the Compsules can be manufactured similarly to the polymers currently used. For capsuled coffee drinkers the Compsules are both airtight and designed to fit user\u2019s current machines, allowing them to be easily adopted.",

    "Technology_Description": "MET s.r.l. is an Italian SME focused on translating the sanitizing action of ozone into innovative industrial applications for transportation, agro-food and, recently, greenhouse crops. Greenhouse farms are very efficient food producers facing two major challenges: a) up to 15% crop losses due to several thousand pests caused by fungi, bacteria and viruses and b) the urgent need to comply with environmental European regulations (Integrated Pest Management) and with the growing demands of European consumers for healthier and environmentally sustainable food (i.e., organic agriculture). Existing solutions are insufficient to cover greenhouse farmer needs: Chemical phytosanitary products are inefficient (pests develop resistance), environmentally undesirable and unsafe for greenhouse workers and consumers (synthetic chemicals may leave toxic rests in food). Biopesticides, yet environmentally friendly, are excessively selective (each substance targets only one or few specific pests) thus ineffective for the broad pest spectrum faced by each greenhouse farmer. In this context, MET has developed O3MET: an innovative technology for spraying aqueous ozone (O3) for pest control and sanitation of greenhouse crops, taking advantage of the powerful oxidation-based (hence non-selective) anti-pathogen action of ozone. O3MET offers greenhouse farmers a solution that is: clean (self-disintegrated into oxygen in a few minutes); cost-effective (\u20ac6000/ha/year savings in chemicals and labour); environmentally sustainable (decreasing the need for polluting chemical pesticides); and safe for workers (remote ozone application by the operator from outside the greenhouse, and minimized post-application safety interval) and food consumers (ozone is residue-free and also extends vegetable shelf life). Once brought to industrial scale, O3MET would reach 10,000 ha of greenhouses (i.e., 2,000 farmers) in the EU/Mediterranean market, with a \u20ac60 million turnover accumulated in 5 years.",

The RLTProFood project aims at a feasibility assessment for a product, the RLT (Remote Lighting technology), that exploiting the energy saver, efficient, and environmental friendly LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) technology, together with customized optical systems, delivers a lighting system for the food working facilities addressing such challenges. The product is a compact system, realized with sustainable components and with a structure that allows to remotely deliver different kinds of light (e.g., visible, and ultraviolet) without losing performance, according customers\u2019 needs. It is easily installed in food industry facilities (e.g., production line or cooking oven), avoiding, with its design, the direct contact with the food. Currently it has two main settings: the LED visible light RLT contributes to optimize the process of lighting food facilities, the UV LED RLT provides a sterilization and germicidal treatment. The product aims to reach the EU market of organic fresh food producers and in particular of vegetables, fruits, dairy, bakery and fresh pasta, where the beneficial effects of the RLT in its two main configurations allow for energy and waste reduction, while improving food safety and quality. The feasibility assessment in the Phase 1 includes: (i) economic viability of the RLT system with its main settings in the EU organic fresh food market with market analysis and a commercialization plan and (ii) technical feasibility of the LED UV RLT developing a pilot application for testing the product in an industry environment. Phase 2 funding could improve the economic assessment of the product in the EU market and implement the pilot application for porting the LED UV RLT in the market.",

    "Technology_Description": "Mastitis is an infection of the udder in dairy cattle. It is a major problem in the dairy industry, costing European farmers tens of millions of Euros annually. Milk somatic cell count (SCC) is used as a main indicator of mastitis, as the number of somatic cells in milk increases in response to infection in the udder. Krysium Technologies has developed and patented LacDetect\u00ae \u2013 an innovative, portable, economic test system allowing reliable and truly rapid detection of sub-clinical mastitis on-farm based on enumeration of SCCs via ATP-luminescence technology. This allows farm workers and veterinarians to make quick decisions on herd management and avoid significant costs associated with clinical mastitis. Furthermore, as SCC is also used as a measurement of milk quality, dairy producers base their milk pricing policy significantly on SCC values in raw milk. LacDetect\u00ae will enable recording of SCCs on-site for payment purposes. LacDetect\u00ae is at Technology Readiness Level 6. Initial testing has repeatedly shown results from our prototype test system compare very favourably with those from a major milk laboratory. In this Phase I project we intend to review the specification of LacDetect\u00ae, to ensure that production costs are reduced and that the end-product specification meets user requirements. We will re-contact and add commercial partners for field testing and commercializing plus explore other routes to market. On completion of Phase I we intend to progress to a Phase II project during which we will carry out final product development, scale-up manufacture, validation and final customer trials prior to commercial launch of LacDetect\u00ae initially in key EU markets. Completion of the overall project will deliver a one-minute, on-farm raw milk test system enabling EU farmers to detect problems in dairy cows early, enabling better antibiotic treatment decisions, improved production, reduction in costs, higher margins, better animal welfare and less environmental impact.",

    "Technology_Description": "The world production of table olives has been increasing in the last few years. According to the International Olive Council (IOC), the 2013/2014 season could reach a production of 2.5 million tons of olives, 4% more than the previous season (2012/2013). Although the table olive production process has become a very high-tech industry in some aspects, one of the most important steps in the process, the debittering stage, is still very much based on the tradition, experience and subjectivity of the technicians who are in charge of it. This is mainly because, to date, there is no available system or tool aimed at improving this process. Thus, there is a clear need in the European table olive industry for technological innovations that can improve the table olive manufacturing processes, particularly in the debittering stage. TELEOLIVA, a new debittering-process monitoring system created by Global Olive, proposes a profound, ground-breaking invention that will lead the transformation of the European traditional table olive sector into an innovative, sustainable and optimized one. The system, which is a set of self-developed ICT tools capable of on-line and real time monitoring of the debittering process, aims to improve product quality by objectively determining the optimal duration of the debittering process stage while reducing production costs and reducing waste generation and negative environmental impacts by avoiding unnecessary input utilization. The main objective of this project is to determine the technical feasibility of the TELEOLIVA system at an industrial scale. At the same time, an economic and market feasibility assessment of the new tool will be conducted in order to prepare a business plan. TELEOLIVA\u00b4s target market includes all table olive manufacturers, beginning with those in Europe and eventually expanding worldwide. Currently, no high-tech solutions such as the TELEOLIVA system are offered by any competing company.",

The technology addresses the public urban piping systems, e.g. for water, gas or district heating, which are today almost fully mechanical, manually controlled and extremely vulnerable with respect to criminal interventions or terroristic attacks. The ACT4INFRA technology has been developed within the past years by the German SME company 3S-Antriebe GmbH. Core of the innovation is a patented rotationally locked support plate (\u2018System Berliner Kappe\u2019), which enables retrofitting of automated actuators in already existing valves without flanging and without a manhole. Additionally, the actuators have been optimized for low energy consumption and can operate fully decentralized powered by batteries. The entire system is controlled by safety-approved wireless communication systems, fulfilling the strong requirements of the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI). No construction work for cabling and no switching cabinet is required. The ACT4INFRA system is a key enabling technology for low cost  retrofitting in order to protect vital urban infrastructure against unauthorized access. This allows to implement smart and secure networks of piping systems. Within ACT4INFRA, 3S strives for systematic market development, distribution strategy and effective international commercialization of this technology on abroad, international mass markets. Thus, Phase 1 starts with a feasibility study , where market structure, customer needs, boundary conditions in different countries and geographical areas, cost structures, economy of scale and production strategies are analyzed. An updated business plan with these results will be prepared.",

    "Technology_Description": "The EASY Project has as its main objective the establishment of a technology that reflects the strategic guidelines for sustainable and profitable development of aquaculture in the EU. In order to follow these guidelines, this project has developed an innovative focused on the development of organic aquaculture feed formula. This formula completely excludes fishmeal and fish oil in its composition, and makes up to 50% cheaper production costs in our product (Tilapia fresh), allowing us to provide the end user, a product with high quality, traceability and profitability. Although Global aquaculture production is increasing, particularly Asian production, European production is stagnated. In EU Countries there is a strong trend in healthier and higher quality fish consumption, furthermore, consumer are requesting fast and comfortable food products without compromising its quality and safety. Obtaining raw material (spirulina and quinoa) inside of our facilities for the production of feed, along with the use of new technologies in the field of aquaponic, is undoubtedly the main key to the viability (feasibility) of EASY Project. The opportunity that this tool SME (Horizon 2020) offers drives the growth of the European inland aquaculture, create new jobs and position us as a world-leader in sustainable aquaculture. Analyzed by University of Murcia the results describe our fish as a very high quality due to the organoleptic properties, and perfectly suitable for the new market challenges. In Phase I our principal aim is to conduct a feasibility study including a business plan and market research with our partners regarding commercialization of the products, specially V range products (new formats), taking advantage over our Asian competitors, thus, becoming a leader in this growing market.",

    "Project_ACR": ["BIWAS"],
    "Technology_Description": "Safe drinking water is essentially a global concern, thus resulting in a considerably large market for water quality monitoring. Besides, potential terrorists might threaten water infrastructure in European cities, since poisoning the tap water is a low-cost attack that easily generates social panic and economic loss to the society. Due to lack of the ideal early warning tools on water safety, large amount of routine sampling and testing have to be done frequently to fight against possible CBRN threats on urban water supply. This project addresses feasibility study for the technical and economic viability of Biological Water Alarm System (BiWAS): An innovative low-cost early warning device for monitoring of drinking water safety over a broad spectrum of harmful substances, including (1) acute toxicant chemicals, (2) chronic carcinogenic chemicals, and (3) waterborne pathogens. The innovative content of BiWAS lies in the miniaturisation and integration with multidisciplinary knowledge, which makes BiWAS a continuous, automatic and portable device working for long period with only annually or biannually maintenance. The potential customers include public water suppliers, household users, hospitals, hotels, culinary and food industries, etc. An early warning system against CBRN threats in drinking water can be realized without more investment. A feasibility assessment on BiWAS product under Phase 1 includes market investigation, business plan development, risk assessment, intellectual property management and innovation strategy development. In the potential Phase 2, a commercializable prototype of BiWAS will be expected, which can be probably the first low-cost and broad-spectrum early warning device for water safety. With the outcome of Phase 1, it will guide the European companies towards the leading role of the global water quality monitoring techniques, and open a big door to the large market of global water quality monitoring, from Europe to the world.",

The following aspects will be pursued: 1) specific marketing tools and sales strategy (Europe, North and South America, Asia) devoted to feedstock producers and micro & small food companies (\u226450 employees), to speed up, the market share achievement (2,6%); 2) product innovation policy to assure the company growth in the food safety business; 3) technical feasibility study for a cost-effective production process (<5 \u20ac/device) and its lay-out definition; 4) revision of the organization growth plans to assure its sustainability; 5) and an updated review of the economical and financial plans. The food sector is the second largest manufacturing industry micro, small and medium sized companies suppose the 99. The business size profile has a relevant impact on the deployment of the safety assurance measures and the feedstock sustainable production (minimization of waste and GHGE). Due to the micro and most of the small companies\u2019 size (< 20 employees), the accomplishment of the mandatory plans for quality and food safety assurance, makes of it a big hurdle difficult to overcome. Alternative rapid kits have been developed to facilitate food pathogen assessment, but none of them, covers the whole microbial detection routine in an easy and affordable way. So, micro and small food companies ought to outsource this service (18-20 \u20ac/test, 8,500 \u20ac/year), with the added drawback of relying a very sensitive issue in third parties. The small dairy, meat and poultry farms, can\u2019t cover these controls, being assumed by the secondary transformers, with the additional costs of logistics, cross-contamination and factory\u2019s stops, if feedstock refuse. The solution has been carefully considered, and it\u2019s a challenge that GTZ is eager to assume, by the manufacture and the market launch of MicroLAB.",

    "Technology_Description": "Natural Machines is a SME that has created the first 3D food printer that works with sweet and savory ingredients. We are focused on helping people get back to home cooking, back to healthy food, by bringing the food processing plant to the home kitchens, giving an eco-efficient alternative to traditional food processing, reducing food waste to zero and with significant savings in energy and packaging needed with no need to spend time cooking or knowing how to do it. Following the lean startup model, we introduced a model for B2B customers that allow them to create dishes, decorations, customizations, suitable for hospitals, restaurants, bakeries, etc. In order to get our product to the home kitchens, users have requested two main features that go far beyond 3D printing technology. The two systems are a new cooking technology that uses just a fraction of the energy used by traditional ovens and microwave ovens and a prefilled capsule system. Both systems working together will convert our new device in an optimised sustainable mini food processing plant at home. The cooking system provides a very granular control of the temperature of the food being cooked, allowing to preserve the nutritional properties of the ingredients and cook according to the user tastes. This system can work also as a standalone device, which opens also new OEM and licensing opportunities for our company. It provides also a safer operation, as no element in the device will be heated to a point of causing harm, as compared to an oven. From a business perspective, reaching the mass market (home kitchens) will allow us to more tan double current revenue forecasts according to initial interest in USA, Europe and Asia, and to introduce new business models, like capsule licensing that will generate new revenue sources. We expect the feasibility study to provide us with a better market insight and a complete business plan for bringing our device to the market.",

This may seem a minor problem but every ship owner knows about the importance of making an adequate choice of antifouling treatments due to associated operating costs. The formation of fouling on ships increases the surface roughness of the hull, which leads to increased fuel consumption. After six months, a ship without an appropriate antifouling system can suffer a 40% increase in fuel consumption to maintain normal speed.  ",

    "Technology_Description": "Today, because of the large dimensions and costs of finishing machines, most printing houses cannot be equipped with a full production line and, after digital printing, they must send fabrics to third companies for finishing and for specific functionalizations. For European SMEs, this leads a general increase of production time and costs and a further threat to competitiveness against the larger and mass-production structured Far East companies. All over Europe, several digital printing SMEs located out of a textile district, are currently suffering the absence of a close, complete supply chain, and they seriously risk of closing their activities because of this scarce completeness. ECOFLEX is going to be proposed to the market of digitally printed fabrics, which is leaded by Europe with 45% total share and is expected to grow in the next years according to recent Industry surveys. Thanks to ECOFLEX, all the operations needed for the textiles finishing and functionalisation will be performed in a single, all-in-one and customized machine, available at low price and compact dimensions. The main benefits for the ECOFLEX users will be: Reduction of the initial investment of about 70%, Reduction of waste and production costs of about 30%, Reduction in the consumption of water and energy of about 30% and 50% respectively, time to market reduction, floor optimization, full control over the quality and repeatability of the final product, resources valorisation.",

The input to such a system is a raw sample of milk, containing the bacteria to be analysed that causes mastitis. Most of the time treatment starts without knowing the responsible pathogen. Often, the wrong (or not most optimal) antibiotic is used as treatment. When therapy fails, new mastitis incidences and prevalence\u2019s are rising. To test, at this moment farmers collect their samples in testing tubes. These tubes should be transported and send to a laboratory. Within the laboratory, the fluid is tested and the farmer receives the results within three (or more) days. The new technology, concerns a more rapid detection method. Within the technique of B4G, it is possible to know which pathogen is responsible for the inflammation to treat mastitis infection within three minutes instead of three days (or more) since the farmer can test it by himself. With a rapid mastitis pathogen test:",

    "Technology_Description": "Sea lice are the most damaging parasite to the salmonid farming industry in Europe, inflicting an annual loss of \u20ac300 million. Lice originating from farms also represent a grave danger to wild populations. Fish farmers use many different methods in the effort to control sea lice infestations. However, none have proved 100% effective and sustainable over time due to environmental impacts, negative consumer perception, violation of fish welfare, and not the least of which is cost. Both governmental bodies and the aquaculture sector are now asking for a sustainable solution to the huge problems resulting from sea lice infestation of both farmed and wild salmonid stocks. Optical delousing (Stingray) is a new proactive, gentle and sustainable method for controlling the amount of sea lice in net pens. Using camera vision, software and laser allow for fully automatic louse removal without posing any danger to farmed fish, other species, or surrounding environment. The project aims to develop a dedicated advanced machine vision unit, the EctoVision, to increase the field of view, depth perception and image processing speed.  The unit will be made available as an upgrade that can be easily integrated with the existing Stingray platform. The aim is to create an efficient range to detect lice and treat fish that passes within 0.4-1.5 m in the proximity of the Stingray to improve the lice removal performance by a twofold. Activities in the feasibility assessment includes  investigation of possible solutions for the machine vision system, mapping best available state of the art and evaluate performance balanced against cost, in addition to search for additional partners. Case studies will be performed to provide a detailed assessment of the expected economic impact using the Stingray with the EctoVision upgrade compared with competing methods. The results will be outlined in a business plan with proper risk assessment, including a preliminary product design specification.",
