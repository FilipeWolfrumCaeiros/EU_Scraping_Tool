<item><Technology_Description>Over 1 billion people suffer from the effects of water scarcity with the vast majority being poor residents of developing countries. Desalting seawater is an excellent potential solution but traditional reverse osmosis (R/O) desalination systems require a connection to a strong electrical grid. However, because developing countries typically lack sufficient electrical grid capacity and cannot afford the capital or time required to build and deploy traditional R/O systems, RML is proposing an innovative solution to this problem - the world’s first wave-driven desalination system (called Wave2O™) that can be deployed quickly, operate completely “off-grid” and supply large quantities of fresh water at competitive cost. </Technology_Description></item>
<item><Technology_Description>This project aims to develop and commercialise VERNE: A non-destructive testing (NDT) system that has the potential to revolutionise underwater inspection of tubular structures by achieving far greater inspection speed and precision compared to existing systems. As the majority of offshore Oil and Gas extraction assets have already exceeded their design lifetime, the need for decommissioning and/or substituting these assets becomes increasingly pressing. However, associated costs are enormous and it will cost nearly €20 billion over the next 10 years to remove around 80 platforms and their associated infrastructure. As asset owners strive to prolong asset lifetime while and minimise risk of catastrophic accidents, the greatest challenge is the inspection and maintenance of subsea structures like jacket foundations and pipelines. In underwater environments the high pressure, seawater and marine life (biofouling) obstruct maintenance operations and accelerate structure degradation. Subsea inspections are currently performed using Remotely Operated Vehicles carrying a payload of cameras, sensors and other equipment. VERNE will dramatically improve on their performance by combining ultrasound and acoustic testing that enable (i) the rapid scanning and defect mapping in a 100m radius around the inspection point and (ii) detailed and precise characterisation once defects are identified. VERNE’s technologies enable inspection of both external and internal surface of structures (e.g. pipelines) without the need to remove anti-corrosion coatings and/or biofouling. As such, VERNE will lead to significant cost savings for asset owners while providing a key competitive advantage to subsea service providers. As such, project partners Dacon and Nardoni anticipate a cumulative turnover of €31.468 million and profits of €19.3 million by Year 5 with a breakeven over the total budget in Year 2 and a ROI rate of 13:1 on EC’s grant.</Technology_Description></item>
<item><Technology_Description>UTB Envirotec Zrt, is one of the Central European market leaders in engineering services for wastewater and organic waste treatment. In the past few years, we have developed a technology for sustainable valorisation of sewage sludge. The treatment of this sludge represents one of the biggest problems for small and medium sized wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in Europe. In our process, called reNEW, the sewage sludge is biologically transformed into volatile fatty acids (VFA) and valuable nutrients (NPK), which are recovered. These products represent important market value: VFA as raw material for eco labelled cleaning agents, and NPK as fertilizer. With the aim of exploitation of the reNEW technology, we formed a spin-off company, Renew Technologies Ltd (RNT) in the UK. Our final aim is to roll-out the technology and widely implement it all over Europe, enabling the growth of our companies. We aim to realise the reNEW project in cooperation of the two companies: RNT being the technology owner and responsible for commercial exploitation, while UTB being the technology provider (design, building and implementation of plants). This initiative has received funding in the Horizon 2020 SME Instrument Phase 1, project number: 728932, duration: 01/07/2016-31/12/2016. We have successfully completed the feasibility study. We verified the technological feasibility as well as the economic viability of the project and further improved our business concept. We demonstrated the efficiency and economic value of the two products, VFA and NPK, respectively and made a scale-up design of our pilot operating currently at our premises (TRL=6). We have improved the proposal and discussed it with our clients, technical partners, and the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN). These discussions and the results of the feasibility assessment have reassured us regarding its merit.</Technology_Description></item>
<item><Technology_Description>In 2016, over 1.2 billion people in the world (16% of the global population) still did not have access to electricity. As the majority of these people are located in remote and rural areas of the world, where conventional power grid extensions are not possible, off-grid energy solutions are required for providing electricity to these areas. Even though such solutions exist today, the options available are painfully limited and costly, whether it be the polluting diesel generators or the solar panels, intermittent energy source requiring complex parks of batteries for energy storage.</Technology_Description></item>

The bow units allow generating and controlling a water flow between the two hulls, even while stationary, offering advanced collection possibilities; [4] Efficiency: collection+bagging system facilitates clean-up of 15 tons/hour of hydrocarbon spills (separation rate of 70-80%; no emulsion creation, which avoids additional effort for splitting water and hydrocarbon); [5] Easy Operation: Our proprietary OC-Tech collecting system avoids the need to go back to the port to upload the recovered hydrocarbon leading to savings in fuel and [man·hours] (≈55%); [6] Easy Transportation: OC-Tech foresees future modular design/construction/re-assembly to be conveyed by road/sea/air, leading to faster action than other options; [7] Profitability: OC-Tech will deliver cumulated revenue of €21.55M and cumulated profit of €10.365M by 2023.</Technology_Description></item>
<item><Technology_Description>Mastitis is one of the most widespread and costly diseases in the dairy industry, inflicting serious damages on a global scale.In herds without an effective mastitis control program, 40 % of cows are infected every 6 months. Treatment of mastitis costs ca. €185 per cow per year. Antibiotic treatment is currently the only solution for treating bacterial mastitis. The antibiotic treatment causes very large losses in milk production and degradation of milk quality, and creates bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics. For many years, scientists all over the world tried to find a non-antibiotic treatment against mastitis. We have developed a highly innovative technology that heals mastitis without resorting to antibiotics. Based on the energetic signature of mastitis pathogens received from the farm computer, our system processes the cows’ drinking water using radio emissions. Infected cows that drink the treated water are healed from mastitis without the need for antibiotics. A working prototype of the system was tested at a 300-cows dairy farm, successfully healing 39 out of the 49 sick cows. Apart from the healing effect, the new treatment facilitates compliance with major EU health regulations. The project will study the requirements for large scale production and delivery of the technology to the dairy industry. It will boost the EU business in milk production and create large environmental, economic and social benefits. Market drivers and a 5-year growth potential will be analysed and a commercialisation strategy will be devised, along with an IPR protection strategy, analysis of competing technologies and planning of promotional and partnership activities. This will enable us to redesign the technology for serial production and scale up for a successful market entry.</Technology_Description></item>
<item><Technology_Description>In irrigation water cannot be decoupled from energy. Raising water from rivers and canals and distribute it to the crops requires pumping of large volumes of water with a sizeable amount of pressure, which is generated by means of electric energy or by fuel-driven pumps. This turns into a substantial increase of energy consumption and capital expenditure, which has become a real concern for farmers and their communities. Besides, sharp increases in energy tariffs almost doubled the energy bills that irrigators have to pay, which accounts for up to 40% of the total irrigation costs for farmers’ communities. In a context exacerbated by the ongoing climate change, European farmers are striving to reduce their water footprint by means of water saving irrigation technologies while optimising their energy costs for pumping, with the aim to ensure long- term economic and environmental sustainability. To address this global need, aQysta has designed the HyPump, an innovative spiral pump which converts the energy from the flow of existing irrigation canals to pressure for pumping water, delivering pressurized water directly to the agriculture plots without requiring any fuel nor electricity to be operated. This Phase 2 is focussed on the industrialisation and field tests of the HyPump, which will allow farmers obtaining up to 75% savings on the overall costs for modernizing infrastructures and running an irrigation system with respect to competing electric or fuel-driven solutions, and up to 37% savings with respect to solar pumps. Through the Cost Benefit Analysis run during Phase 1, annual net savings have been estimated in the range of 5k€-8k€ per hectare with respect to electric pumping. Besides, a payback time in the range of 2,5-4 years has been estimated when switching from an electric or fuel- operated system to the HyPump, obtained with zero environmental footprint with respect to fuel or energy powered pumps.</Technology_Description></item>
<item><Technology_Description>Biofouling, i.e. the formation of deposits of biomolecules or even bacteria in the surface of the medical device, is the main cause of the loss of the devices performance. LipoCoat’s patented nano-coatings make use of lipid bilayers to prevent biofouling of medical devices when placed into contact with bodily fluids in- or outside of the body. Our natural and bio-inspired coating makes use of molecules found in every cell, making it extremely biocompatible. The neutral LipoCoat molecules can efficiently attract water thus preventing any interaction with proteins and cells. Furthermore, LipoCoat can stably apply these layers using our proprietary LipoCoat FAST manufacturing process.</Technology_Description></item>
<item><Technology_Description>The CO2EXIDE project aims at the development of a combined electrochemical-chemical technology for the simultaneous “200%” conversion of CO2 to ethylene at the cathode, water oxidation to hydrogen peroxide at the anode and a subsequent chemical conversion of both intermediates to ethylene oxide and oligo-/polyethylene glycol in a cascade, boosting this technology from TRL4 to TRL6. The CO2EXIDE technology combines a modular nature for the feasibility of a decentralised application, a high energy and material efficieny/yield and the substitution of fossil based production of ethylene oxide. The CO2EXIDE technology will be combinable with renewables and allows for the direct creation of products, which can be integrated into the existing supply chain. The reactions will be operated at low temperatures and pressures and forecast significant improvements in energy and resource efficiency combined with an enormous reduction of GHG emissions. All improvements will be quantitated using Life Cycle Assessment. </Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>The use of solar energy for photoelectrochemically splitting water into H2 and O2 has been widely investigated for producing sustainable H2 fuel. However, no commercialisation of this technology has emerged. Currently the main obstacles to commercialisation are: low solar-to-hydrogen efficiency, expensive electrode materials, fast degradation of prototypes, and energy losses in separating H2 from O2 and water vapour in the output stream. The FotoH2 consortium has identified a new scientific direction for achieving cost-effective solar-driven H2 production, and it has the capability of large-scale prototyping and field testing the proposed technology. FotoH2 introduces anion-exchange polymer membrane and porous hydrophobic backing concepts in a tandem photoelectrochemical cell, and a novel way to stabilise the photoelectrodes based on a surface phase transformation. This approach allows the use of cost-effective metal oxide electrodes with optimal bandgaps and a simple flow-cell design without corrosive electrolytes. </Technology_Description></item>
<item><Technology_Description>The project aims at a holistic new design strategy, coordinated pilot lines and business model for the prototyping, fabrication and commercialization of polymer-based microfluidic systems.  It stems from the recognition that a microfluidic chip is a key part of a microfluidic MEMS, but only a part. Many limitations to fast prototyping, industrialization and ultimate performances lie not in the chip itself, but in the world-to-chip connections and integration of multiple external components. We shall address in a single strategy the streamlined construction of whole microfluidic systems, starting from existing pilot lines in injection moulding, 3D printing and instrument construction. This will specific innovations. First, the resolution of 3D printing will be increased by a factor at least 10, down to  1~3µm, with a throughput 10 to 100x higher than that of current high resolution 3D printing machines, to support the flexible production of chips with complex 3D architectures. New soft, bio, environment-friendly and/or active materials will be integrated in the production chain using a technology patented by the partners. Large-scale markets requiring mass production at the lowest cost  will be addressed by a fully integrated pilot line, streamlining injection moulding of raw chips, reagents and components integration, sealing  and quality control.  Inter-compatibility between 3D printing and injection moulding, regarding architectures  and materials, will be developed to accelerate the prototype to product value chain.  After development and upscaling, the technology will be demonstrated and qualified in operational environment  by end-users with lab-on-chip  applications in health (cancer diagnosis, organ-on chip) and environment (water control). Partners jointly have the production lines onto which the project’s innovation will be readily integrated, helping  microfluidics to become a major component of the 4th industrial revolution.</Technology_Description></item>
<item><Technology_Description>Near 58 billion paper cups are used globally per year. This involves the consumption of one million tonnes of virgin paper, cutting down 32 million trees, the consumption of 100 billion litres of water, the generation of 25,000 tonnes of waste (solely in the UK), and the emission of greenhouses gases equivalent to half a million cars. Paper cups are often lined or coated with plastic such as polyethylene (PE) or oil- based waxes to prevent the liquid from leaking out or soaking through the paper. These paper cups are almost impossible to recycle because of the difficulties of separating the paper from waterproof oil-based liners. This means paper cups end up going to landfill or, at best, are incinerated to generate energy. The heavy environmental impact of paper cups is extremely unsustainable, with each one generating a carbon footprint of 0.11kg of CO2. </Technology_Description></item>
<item><Technology_Description>Since 1947 Kabola develops, manufactures and sells heating systems for vehicles (boats and wheeled vehicles – truck, vans, etc.) and other applications. Kabola has a broad portfolio of diesel, heating oil and biodiesel boilers adapted to the requirements of its customers. Kabola is well known for its classic red cube heaters HR, Compact 7 and B series. In the last years, the increasing pressure for more efficient and greener heating systems encouraged Kabola to develop the new Kabola Blue Ecoline (KB Eco) series. The KB Eco is the outcome of the implementation of the innovative Kabola Blue technology (The Kabola Blue technology allows diesel to burn a blue flame at around 1.500 ºC compared to the 800 ºC of the yellow flame in conventional systems) into the successful HR series. In comparison with its competitors, KB Eco is much more efficient (94% constant over time vs. a degradable 70-90%) and it does not produce soot (both certified by TÜV), it has the best low emission values (NOx, CO, etc) granted with the eco-label “Blauer Engel” (Blue Angel) and require very low maintenance since there is no soot production. KB Eco is sold now with power outputs from 7 kW to 38 kW. The current KB Eco series is highly efficient and clean, however there are still needs not covered in the market that guarantee the profitability of an improved KB Ecoline version (KB Plus) that will include: a new ultra compact model for vehicles with high restrictions in terms of space such as trucks or vans, higher efficiency in all models reaching an outstanding 106% efficiency thanks to a new design and technology, a new range of higher output power models for large boats, availability of clean water a valuable resource in ships, electrical heating and other improvements. Highly efficient and non pollutant heating systems for vehicles represent a huge business opportunity. Proof of that is the 700 units of the KB Eco sold in the last 2 years. KB Plus will boost the current sales of the KB Eco.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>The company FLEXBIO Technologie GmbH will technologically finalise and commercialise the FLEXBIO process in form of a biological wastewater treatment plant for organically contaminated wastewater, e.g. from the food and beverage industry. In this process, which was developed in cooperation with the HAWK university in Germany, organic contaminants in the wastewater are converted into biogas under anaerobic conditions in a fixed-bed reactor. An optional second treatment step, a trickling filter, can moreover remove nitrogen compounds and further increase the treatment efficiency of the plant. Compared to the aerobic activated sludge process, which currently is the most important process for the treatment of organically contaminated wastewater, the FLEXBIO process has several important advantages: at a comparable treatment efficiency (more than 97 %), the FLEXBIO process requires much less energy (heating or aeration not necessary), produces much less sludge to be disposed of, is much more flexible to variations in the wastewater, can be installed in a compact and mobile container and produces biogas for the generation of heat or electricity. The FLEXBIO process offers an environmentally friendly solution for the decentralised treatment of wastewater especially for SMEs, clearly improving their economic performance.</Technology_Description></item>
<item><Technology_Description>Nanostructured surfaces that engineer the interaction between an object and its surroundings are a subject of scientific and manufacturing importance. Nature routinely creates nanostructured surfaces with fascinating properties, such as antireflective moth eyes, self-cleaning lotus leaves, colourful butterfly wings, and water harvesting desert beetles. Well defined nanostructured surfaces have huge commercial potential due to product enhancement: reduced reflectivity in photonic devices and solar panels, antiglare plastic parts for the automotive industry, hydrophobic self-cleaning surfaces for smart packaging, antireflective and smudge-free smartphone displays, and biofouling resistant marine and water treatment systems. Unfortunately, the lack of cost-effective, scalable, nanopatterning methods is a major hurdle for the commercial exploitation of nanopatterned surfaces. SUN-PILOT will address this challenge by developing a novel and cost effective platform for up-scaling sub-wavelength nanostructures fabrication techniques that can be applied to curved surfaces such as optical lenses, and the mass production of metal moulds for injection moulding of plastic parts. The expected impact of SUN-PILOT for the Optics Industry is a disruptive technology that will boost the performance/cost ratio of photonic devices by piloting mass fabrication of scratch and wear resistant nanopatterned antireflective optical surfaces. Significant enhancement will be achieved in the efficiency of optical components and systems incorporating these devices, such as laser systems, electronic displays, security cameras and medical devices. The Automotive Industry will benefit from a novel method to produce functional surfaces at lower cost and lighter weight than existing lamination methods.  This proposal brings together scientists and engineers to span innovation, business development and the product cycle from suppliers to end users and will ensure a leadership role of for Europe.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>More than a billion people currently live in water-scarce regions, and as many as 3.5 billion could experience water scarcity   by 2025. Forecasts estimate that water demand in 2040 will exceed supply by 50%. Seawater amounts to 97% of all water   contained on Earth and can, fortunately, be converted into fresh water by desalination. Desalination processes are still expensive, energy intensive and commonly pose great negative impacts on ecosystems. Presently, no current state-of-the-art solutions suggest sustainable technologies to the Earth’s ecosystem. The Reverse Osmosis (RO) membrane segment, which is the largest of the membrane market, was valuated at €1.1 billion in 2015 and is projected to grow by 43% over the 8-year period from 2014 to 2021, reaching a €2.5 billion revenue by 2021. Part of the RO market is dominated by brackish water reverse osmosis membranes (BWRO). Brackish water is water that has higher salinity than fresh water (more than 0.05%) and lower than seawater (less than 3%). Aquaporin A/S has acknowledged this huge business opportunity and has developed a ground-breaking biomimetic technology to separate and purify water from other compounds based on nature’s own principles: Aquaporin water channel proteins. This technology will potentially disrupt the current RO technology, making it more energy and water efficient as well as more sustainable and cost-effective. Since we have a commercial Aquaporin Inside™ RO membrane already tested and validated at low pressure conditions (house hold, 7 bar), our main goal within this project will be to optimise and up-scale this to work at brackish water conditions (15 bar) in both flat sheet and spiral wound module formats. Aquaporin Inside™ Brackish Water RO membranes will boost our growth and consolidate a worldwide reference for us, thereby drastically differentiate us from competitors, and will open the possibility to also get into the seawater desalination market in the near future.</Technology_Description></item>
<item><Technology_Description>European agriculture is facing important challenges in the coming decades linked to our changing climate. Periods of droughts and floods will further increase which threaten production and require a smart usage of our vulnerable water resources. Climate change also stimulates crop disease, which causes farmers to use more pesticides and in turn endangers water quality and impacts people's health and the environment. Satellite Remote Sensing has a crucial role to play in tackling these challenges. At VanderSat we have developed a method to provide accurate high-resolution images of soil moisture, at any place on Earth 24/7 a year. Soil moisture is a key indicator for the physical status of a plant, and has a strong predictive value with respect to crop yield and weather conditions including flooding and droughts. By combining microwave data obtained from different satellites – including the ones in the Copernicus Sentinel constellation – we are revealing a revolutionary data set that can be used to retrieve key information about the water availability for crops at field level. This data is crucial for improving the accuracy of Agricultural (Ag.) models that are the backbone of modern agribusiness. Through the WATER4AGRI project we want to lift the technology to TRL9 by: (1) scaling VanderSat soil moisture for implementation in Ag. models and, (2) demonstrating the effectiveness of VanderSat in the two most widespread Ag. models. With VanderSat our customers will be able to accurately predict crop yield, pesticide requirements, droughts and flooding and, most important, reduce climate related risks for their businesses. VanderSat is creating business opportunities that were unimaginable before, like reducing crop risks through smart re-insurance strategies and integrated pest management. In doing this VanderSat impacts agribusiness in the most important dimension: improving yield and the overall profit or loss of the operation.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>Legionnaires’ disease is a serious form of pneumonia caused by bacterium Legionella pneumophila, with a case-fatality ratio on the order of 10-15%. L. pneumophila proliferates in aquatic habitats, especially in potable water, air conditioning, hot and cold water systems, cooling towers, evaporative condensers, spa/natural pools. Actually, its detection and monitoring rely on time-consuming protocols (in the order of several days) based on in-vitro selective bacteria culture methods, performed by highly specialized personnel in dedicated laboratories. POSEIDON project targets to change the approach in bacteriological environmental monitoring and in infection risk management by developing a fully automatic and reliable system. Handling of the air/water sample will be designed and integrated in preconditioning system and microfluidic device through which whole bacteria cells will be transported from the sampling module to the sensing plasmonic surface. The complete measure protocol will be integrated and performed according to EU legislation guidelines. Specificity will be ensured by immuno-functionalization of gratings surfaces and enhanced system sensitivity will be granted by the optimization of the optical detection system architecture. Sensors based on Grating Coupled Surface Plasmon Resonance (GC-SPR) in azimuthally rotating configuration have recently proved sensitivity enhancement up to almost two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the symmetry breaking related to grating rotation allows exploiting the incident polarization, more easily controlled with respect to incidence wavelength and angles interrogation. The prototype will be designed to be integrated in water distribution or HVAC systems in order to demonstrate its feasibility in industrially relevant fields and to open new applications and new market opportunities.

<item><Technology_Description>Humanity’s plans to further explore space require the development of bio-regenerative life support systems and in particular plant cultivation. Plants contribute to all major life support functions by producing food and oxygen, reducing carbon dioxide and recycling water and waste. Moreover, fresh crops also have a positive impact on crew psychological well-being. EDEN ISS aims to adapt, integrate and demonstrate plant cultivation technologies and operations procedures for safe food production on-board the International Space Station and for future human space exploration missions. The consortium will demonstrate operational capability of controlled environment agriculture technologies and procedures for safe food production in space. A mobile test facility will be built to provide realistic interfaces analogous to ISS. A one-year demonstration campaign at the Neumayer III Antarctic station will provide extensive testing and validation capability to increase the technology readiness level of key subsystems to 6. Further developing these technologies and operations procedures, including food quality and safety measurements, will also contribute to Europe’s interest in resource efficient crop cultivation, saving energy, countering the climate change and securing the supply of healthy and safe food.

<item><Technology_Description>Company ESDA has developed HeatSel®, the first viable macro-encapsulation solution functioning with phase change materials (PCM) for latent thermal energy storage in heating and cooling systems. Accounting for 50% of the EU's annual energy consumption, heating and cooling is the sector with the biggest energy-saving potential in Europe, and urgently needs to become more sustainable. In the low temperature range (5 to +100°C), most thermal energy amounts are required and then discarded worldwide. PCM are key materials to save these huge energy and – at the same time – CO2 amounts. They can run through a reproducible phase-change at a substance-specific temperature, during which the thermal energy is either stored in very large amounts or returned at a constant temperature. Since decades, an adequate method is being sought to transfer PCM into a user-friendly form. Both existing micro- and macro-encapsulation solutions for PCM storage have until now revealed industrially, technically and economically inappropriate. Sensible heat storage with large water storage tanks has very low energy density and storage capacity. ESDA is specialist in the technical extrusion of blow-moulded parts and has in the past 5 years acquired expert knowledge in PCM and thermal storage technology. HeatSel® is a PCM-filled capsule for use in aqueous systems as a heat transfer medium. Most unique selling points of the solution are: universal applicability with diverse (even older) heat exchangers; high energy efficiency through the re-use of waste energy (4 times more efficient than water heat storage) and boosting of renewable energy such as solar thermal technology. Primary target market is the high-volume heating and cooling market in residential buildings in Europe, secondary market is industrial process heat/cooling. ESDA foresees a large impact for HeatSel® in combination with solar thermal and heat pump systems, with a cumulated turnover of €33.7M and 56 job creations by 2023.</Technology_Description></item>
<item><Technology_Description>SUPREME aims at optimizing powder metallurgy processes throughout the supply chain. It will focus on a combination of fast-growing industrial production routes and advanced ferrous and non-ferrous metals. By offering more integrated, flexible and sustainable processes for powders manufacturing and metallic parts fabrication, SUPREME enables the reduction of the raw material resources (minerals, metal powder, gas and water) losses while improving energy efficiency, production rate and CO2 emissions, into sustainable processes and towards a circular economy. To achieve this goal, an ambitious cross-sectorial integration and optimization has been designed between several powder metallurgy processes: gas and water atomization as well as ball milling for metal powder production, additive manufacturing and near-net shape technologies for end-parts fabrication. Quality and process control will be developed to monitor KPI, based on eco-innovation approach, to demonstrate the optimization of material and energy use. 4 demonstrators will be proposed at each step of the value chain in real industrial setting and ready for business exploitation at TRL 7: mineral concentration, metal powder manufacturing, metal part manufacturing and end-product that will validate a global optimization of more than 25% on material yield losses, more than 10% on energy efficiency, more than 10% on production rate and beyond 30% of CO2 emissions. SUPREME has gathered an outstanding consortium of 17 partners from 8 countries, represented by 11 companies including 6 SMEs that will ensure a successful implementation towards market applications. 5 applications sectors are targeted: automotive, aeronautics, cutting tools, molding tools and medical. The process key differentiation advantages will bring modularity, flexibility and sustainability to powder metallurgy and will reduce the total cost breakdown of these technologies, boosting their adoption by industry.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>There is a compelling need of encouraging energy efficiency in buildings, enhance green technologies and promote advance thermal energy storage solutions. TESSe2b will enable the optimal use of renewable energy and provide one of the most advantageous solutions for correcting the mismatch that often occurs between the supply and demand of energy in residential buildings. The target of TESSe2b is to design, develop, validate and demonstrate a modular and low cost thermal storage technology based on solar collectors and highly efficient heat pumps for heating, cooling and domestic hot water (DHW) production. The idea is to develop advanced compact integrated PCM TES tanks exploiting RES (solar and geothermal) in an efficient manner coupled with enhanced PCM borehole heat exchangers (BHEs) that will take advantage of the increased underground thermal storage and maximize the efficiency of the ground coupled heat pumps (GCHP). The two TES tanks developed within TESSe2b project will be integrated with different PCM materials; (i) enhanced paraffin PCM, (ii) salt-hydrates PCM, while in both of them a highly efficient heat exchanger will be included. Even if the concept of phase change thermal stores has been demonstrated, TESSe2b project discriminates itself through incorporating; (i) PCM materials innovation, (ii) advanced energy management through self-learning model-based control system, (iii) enhanced PCM BHEs (v) compact modular design of thermal storage tank. Since the lifetime of TESSe2b solution is among the most critical factors determining its acceptability, reliability and success the on the long run, special emphasis will be given in the life-expectancy of the involved components.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>The scope of the project is the optimization of downstream process (DSP) for the production of Biopharmaceuticals. Biopharmaceuticals have been successfully used as efficient therapeutic drugs for many pathophysiological conditions since the first recombinant product, insulin, was approved in 1982. Despite its efficacy, accessibility is still limited due to extremely high costs. In the production chain, capturing and purifying still represents a major bottleneck. Consequently, improvements in this area produce substantial cost reductions and expand patients’ accessibility to highly efficient drugs. Another aim of this action is to cope with the changing manufacturing demands, by lowering its environmental footprint and moving to more sustainable technologies. This proposal’s main objective is to implement a fully integrated manufacturing platform based on continuous chromatography in combination with disposable techniques for all unit operations of the DSP sequence for biosimilar monoclonal antibodies and derivatives thereof. The action encompasses the entire DSP sequence. We will implement alternative technologies for primary separation, such as flocculation or tangential flow filtration. The expected outcome is a reduction in the size and number of downstream unit operations and the elimination of centrifugation. Alternative approaches to the batch process for the capture step, such as continuous chromatography, will be evaluated in order to improve the efficiency and lower the need for expensive resin volume. Additionally precipitation utilization will be evaluated as an approach to replace protein A chromatography as capture step. A disposable continuous chromatography system will be developed together with novel analytical tools and sensors. Since single-use disposable systems can substitute the extensive use of resources (water) and significantly reduce the overall utility needs, the whole DSP sequence will be carried out on disposable technology (PAT).</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>Blue Farm will enable the fish farming industry to move their production from today’s protected inshore ocean space to harsh weather conditions of the open ocean, through piloting and later commercialising a patented fish cage demonstrated to operate in 10M high waves. Our fish cage is designed and tested to handle 10 meter high waves. Much of the structure is made of concrete that has given low long-term cost in similar oil and gas projects. The fish cage is much larger than traditional fish cages (allowed by larger water resources offshore). This gives economics of scale in operation (e.g. spreading the cost of automation tech). The fish cage provides calm living environment for the fish through a wind- and wave breaker. The openings of the wind and wave breaker are designed by simulation programs run by Egersund Net (world’s largest fish net provider). Also, water quality is better offshore than in inshore environment with dense fish farming activity.

<item><Technology_Description>Sphagnum peat moss is a valued, recognized, natural, organic reserve that is largely harvested for use as a soil conditioner or amendment in horticulture. It is often referred to as the universal soil conditioner for its benefits to the soil. The decayed and dried sphagnum peat moss is usually referred to as simply peat. As a soil amendment, it is free of weed seeds, pests and pathogens and can absorb up to 20 times its weight in water. The peat bogs from which peat moss is derived are one of the most distinctive kinds of wetlands. Peat bogs are an important environmental resource and create areas of huge biodiversity, keeping more carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere than forests, and helping to prevent flooding. Problem: Naturally formed peat has been harvested for centuries, and European supplies are seriously depleted in England, Holland and Germany, and are in the process of being commercially harvested in areas of Eastern Europe. This harvesting causes serious environmental problems, as the peat cannot be regenerated within our lifetimes. Habitats are destroyed, and the carbon balance is badly affected, as peatlands are major stores of carbon and are vital environmental ‘regulators’. Many peatlands globally, which have been farmed for peat, are now sources of greenhouse gases, owing to degradation and oxidation of the unsaturated peat layer. The UK government are currently working to completely phase out the use of peat based products in UK Horticulture by 2030, but there is presently no viable alternative growing media which offers the same quality as peat. This project is to determine the business opportunity for the commercialisation of a method to grow moss on a large scale, on mats, which will speed up significantly the growing process, enabling the production of a sustainable growing media for horticulture (replacing peat) and creating a valuable cash crop opportunity for farmers.</Technology_Description></item>
<item><Technology_Description>In the vaccine industry, downstream processing is of extreme importance. Prophylactic vaccines aim at protecting healthy people, so any contaminant has to be discarded with the most drastic measures. Such « negative » approach comes at the expense of the recovery of product : yields are poor, thereby inducing a high product cost. Processes are also complex, since they rely on multiple eliminations rather than on recovery of the unique product of interest. Technically, this is mostly due to the lack of specific capture systems that would allow direct, « positive » separation of the vaccine from its environment.Vaccines know no borders. For developing countries, the pressure on costs is even more acute, and local production is a way to try to reach the 1$ per dose target. In this context, water sustainability is a major issue, as it is a most sensitive ingredient in bioproduction.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>The overall aim of the project is to develop a new production concept for converting CO2 to white oils and aliphatic high molecular weight waxes. The products are used for wax emulsions and white oils to be used in coatings and sealant materials. The properties of the raw materials will be tested against current fossil based materials. The main raw material for the process is CO2 which is available from processes currently operating at a large industrial site with significant annual CO2 emissions. H2 is obtained as by product from a chlor-alkali plant on the site. Currently H2 is produced in excess and it is used mainly for energy production. Currently at this chemical production site about 2 million tons/a of CO2 is vented to the atmosphere, creating a huge GHG emission reduction potential. The core of this project is a combination of reverse water gas shift (RWGS) coupled with advanced, modular Fischer-Tropsch (FT) technology. The RWGS-step converts CO2 with H2 to carbon monoxide. The following FT-reaction step will be carried out in a novel intensified reactor recently developed and patented by Ineratec. Over 1500 kg of white oils and high-molecular weight wax will be manufactured using a container-sized microstructured reactor system.

<item><Technology_Description>Hose reel irrigation systems are a type of sprinkler irrigation which is best used on irregular-shaped and difficult-to-reach areas. Although it is widely used, it presents some problems related to the high degree of friction between the hose carrying the water, and the ground. This fact implies larger labor force to move the hose, therefore provoking an inefficient use of resources (water and fuel); thus increasing fuel consumption and GHG emissions. This becomes particularly difficult at the time of rainy or muddy grounds by getting the hose stuck on the soil with no possibility to move and with the eventual broken of the hose or even the machine drive system. Moreover, the abrasion produced by the constant friction, deteriorates the hose, reducing its useful life. </Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>Ordinary ready-mixed concrete is made of sand, cement, water, stone gravel and additives. Albeit aggregate gravel is chosen for its high compressive strength and relatively low cost, its use is associated with different problems. Due to its high density, any construction will require more steel reinforcement to support the weight of the heavy concrete. The different sizes and shapes as well as the inconsistent distribution of the gravel causes air and water voids, causing weak points and is responsible for crack propagation in the concrete structure. Despite technical problems, the usage of gravel is also responsible for significant amounts of quarrying, transportation costs and CO2 emissions. We have innovated and developed a novel process and a system (consisting of the GEM-TECHTM machine and GEM-SOLTM catalyst) that creates a ‘superior foam’, which does not drain off for at least 12 hours, providing sufficient time for the cement to set resulting in high compressive strengths. The geodesic structure that is created by the novel mixing screw action and the ingredients that are mixed systematically in the GEM-TECHTM machine without using any gravel or any admixtures into GEM-TECHTM ready-mixed material provide significant cost savings. The main objectives of the ReMix project is to investigate the feasibility of developing different size machines with different specifications, examine the commercial and technical risks of the process, develop strategies to meet different standard requirements and develop strategies to commerialise our unique product.  The overall objective is to develop an advanced ready mixed concrete replacement material, which is at least 45% cheaper, 28% lighter, with high compressive and flexural strengths. Our main goal is to establish GEM-TECH technology as a novel replacement for the existing ready-mixed concrete ageing technology.

<item><Technology_Description>The alarming rate of biodiversity loss and ecosystem transitions make it clear that new strategies are required to sustain functioning of the coupled ecological-societal system. Existing space data archives and data streams from the ESA Sentinels, offer unprecedented opportunities to provide rapid, high quality indicators necessary for informed management of key ecosystem services. Yet, it remains largely unclear how space and ground-based observations can be optimally integrated to generate products required by end user communities (Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, 2014). By fusing extensive expertise on optical and radar remote sensing, ground data on ecosystem state and function, “big data” scientists, and active participation of user groups, BACI will advance this integration. BACI will translate space data to new variables (not directly observable from space) that encode ecosystem functional properties and status metrics. This will empower concepts of “essential biodiversity variables”. Advanced machine learning methods will be employed to reveal new and fundamental relationships between space observations and ecosystem status. BACI will incorporate a wide range of original data and downstream data products specifically targeting needs for early-warning systems, including a novel “Biosphere-Atmosphere Change Index”. We will prioritize selected key European and African regions now undergoing massive societal-ecological transformations, offering perspective towards operational assessments. A formal attribution framework will disentangle climate-induced ecosystem changes and socioeconomic/ecological transformation processes. Overall, BACI will advance usage of European space data to monitor relevant vegetation traits, status, and ecosystem functioning. By capitalizing on existing datasets, we will prototype new algorithms to rapidly implement these metrics and thus space-to-ground integration of the new ESA Sentinels.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>Oil and gas is continuously leaking from offshore deepwater infrastructure. Up to 1 million tonnes of oil are lost from deepwater drilling leaks each year, with 601 oil and gas releases reported in the North Sea in 2015 alone, up 14.5% on the previous years. Current leak detection technologies suffer from high false positives, high cost, lack of continuous monitoring and safety risks, meaning the majority of leaks are not detected by equipment. To address this major environmental and economic problem, we have developed STREAM, a unique technology which uses subtle changes in the speed of sound to detect contaminants in seawater. We have recently completed a funded project to technically prove our concept at TRL6.</Technology_Description></item>
<item><Technology_Description>The interest for renewable energies has exponentially risen in the last few years. Several factors have contributed to this growth, highlighting the increase of the energy demand, the political instability of many countries that produce fossil fuels, the high fluctuation of oil prices, the countries’ energy dependence and the concern generated by the environmental impact produced by the traditional sources of energy. This fact has boosted the development of numerous renewable energies and has promoted the establishment of ambitious objectives by the main world organisations, like the one set by the European Commission of covering 20% of the energy demand with renewable energies by 2020. By using current marine energy harnessing technology, it would be possible to provide up to 13% of the global energy, by extracting 2.200 TWh/year.</Technology_Description></item>
<item><Technology_Description>Materiko is an Italian company specialising in the manufacture of revolutionary artificial high quality textiles. Due to the flexibility, and high-quality afforded by genuine leather, compared to conventional textiles, it has been used for centuries as material in several industries. However, leather is prone to scratching, water damage and UV damage which can limit its uses, particularly in external applications. Furthermore, the way in which leather is produced presents a huge environmental problem. The tanning process for genuine leather uses on average 360 L of water per m2 and over 50 L of that needs to be processing by wastewater treatment plants for chromium waste considered to be hugely toxic by the EU. To alleviate these environmental problems as well as consumer movement towards non-animal origin products a range of artificial leathers have been developed such as PVC and polyurethane (PU) based faux leathers and natural plant based options. PVC and PU based artificial leather have their own environmental problems including similarly high water usage, use of toxic chemicals and poor recyclability. Both plastic based and plant based leather alternatives have durability and quality issues when replicating genuine leather. The need for a high-quality, more durable, weather-proof leather like material which eliminates animal cruelty, water usage and toxic wastage associated with the genuine leather industry is clear and one for which Materiko have developed an innovative solution. Our EcoLeather is a novel material manufactured using an innovative semi-automatic manufacturing technique which produces a water and chemical free leather alternative which improves upon the physical properties of genuine, such as durability, scratch and weather resistance. With the high-end leather goods market worth an estimated €45 bn globally there is a huge demand for a leather alternative with improved physical properties.</Technology_Description></item>
<item><Technology_Description>The main goal of the proposed project URBANFLUXES (URBan ANthrpogenic heat FLUX from Earth observation Satellites) is to investigate the potential of Earth Observation (EO) to retrieve anthropogenic heat fluxes. The main research question addresses whether EO is able to provide reliable estimates of anthropogenic heat flux spatiotemporal distribution, at local and city scales. URBANFLUXES will investigate the potential of EO to retrieve the anthropogenic heat flux, as a key component in the urban energy budget and by developing a method capable of deriving it from space. The objective is to develop a method that could be used operationally in the near future, when observations with adequate temporal resolution become available. URBANFLUXES EO-based approach will be easily transferable to any urban area and capable of providing anthropogenic heat flux benchmark data for different applications, including climate models to assess the implication of the anthropogenic heat on the Earth system; building energy models to characterize buildings-to-atmosphere/soil/water heat exchange pathways; and decision support systems for urban sustainable planning and mapping of emissions related to energy consumption. URBANFLUXES is therefore expected to prepare the ground for further innovative exploitation of European space data in scientific activities (Earth system modelling and climate change studies in cities) and future and emerging applications (sustainable urban planning) by exploiting the improved data quality, coverage and revisit times of the Copernicus Sentinels data. The Copernicus observations have the potential to reveal novel scientific insights, related to monitoring the anthropogenic heat flux in cities, at both local and regional scales, generating new EO opportunities. The URBANFLUXES products will therefore support both sustainable planning strategies to improve the quality of life in cities and Earth system models to provide more robust climate simulations.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>A Bottom hole assembly (BHA) is a series of components that form the lower part of the drill string, extending from the bit to the drill pipe. During oil and gas exploration the BHA can become stuck/jammed due to poor cleaning of the hole and subsequent build-up of cuttings. With direction drilling programmes now exceeding 10km, problems are becoming more common and expensive as oil exploration companies look to access difficult to extract oil reserves from reservoirs which until recently were not commercially viable, particularly in deep water. Methods of disconnecting the BHA need to be activated in highly deviated or horizontal wells where wireline systems cannot easily be employed. In development and exploration drilling, the costs when the BHA becomes stuck down the hole are considerable. </Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>The progressive ageing of the population is becoming a major problem for society, who sees how ageing comes accompanied by crucial challenges that constraint our healthcare systems. Dependency is one of these challenges, adopting today the form of over 3 million Europeans unable to live independently due to ageing, disease, accidents or long term disability. These individuals rely and depend on caregivers to accomplish daily activities, being hygiene one of the most critical steps. Fulfilling hygiene tasks becomes specially challenging and time-consuming for the saturated personnel at hospitals, clinics or elderly homes, who need to be extra careful with these patients at higher risk of infection. The complexity of the current processes to wash or bathe bedbound patients (which involves transferring the patient out of bed) enters in conflict with the workload pressure faced by caregivers (which limits the time available for each patient). In response, we have developed and validated Aquabuddy-CARE (AQB), a miniaturized and portable shower system that enables patients to undertake hygiene tasks in bed, rapidly and in a dignified manner. The combination of advanced materials, sustainable production process and proprietary water flow system guarantees the efficiency of the technology concerning water consumption and prevention of contamination. After completing the validation at the pilot scale, this project aims to finalise the industrialization and field-testing of AQB. The Feasibility Study planned in Phase 1 will help us secure the project from all technical, financial and commercial standpoints. Once in the market, AQB will bring significant benefits for caregivers and patients worldwide, helping to alleviate the raising impact of ageing and disability while improving their life quality. In turn, AQB will boost our growth, expecting to hire 12 new people in 5 years, gain €11.2 million in profits and reach a ROI of 4.6 per euro invested in the project.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>The use of renewable resources in the process industries is socially desirable and a market pull for products has started to develop in recent years, but renewable products have to compete with identical or similar-in-application products based on fossil raw materials in terms of quality and production cost. One of the main reasons for currently higher production costs of products based on renewable resources is that the production routes involve processing complex dilute aqueous solutions from which the desired products have to be separated during downstream processing. Consequently, a major challenge the process industry is facing, is the development of cost- and energy-efficient water removal and product-recovery techniques. Today downstream processes for products based on renewable resources are often developed using methods from the petrochemical area being insufficiently adapted to the new applications. A re-thinking of downstream process development and the development of suitable methodologies for a fast-track development of tailored downstream processes as well as the optimisation of separation technologies are urgently needed in order to unlock the potential of the renewable-based product market for the European process industry.   </Technology_Description></item>

Mammographic screening is effective in reducing mortality, however the 10-year cumulative false-positive risk is 50-60%, leading to needless additional invasive procedures (e.g. biopsy). The project addresses the unmet clinical need for higher specificity in breast cancer imaging following screening by fully combining photonics with non-photonics techniques, developing and clinically validating innovative and previously unthinkable photonics concepts and components: time-domain small source-detector distance optical tomography, miniaturized picosecond pulsed laser sources, high-dynamic-range time-gated single-photons detectors to achieve unprecedented sensitivity and depth penetration. For the first time, this allows a comprehensive quantitative characterization of breast tissue including composition (water, lipids, collagen), functional blood parameters, morphologic information and mechanical parameters (stiffness). This innovative multi-parametric characterization will significantly improve the specificity of breast screening, with great impact on the quality of life of millions of European women every year, and huge savings for the healthcare systems.

Another unsolved problem is the large space requirement of the heat source system and the unfavorable cost/benefit relation. Therefore Holzammer Kunststofftechnik GmbH and GeoCollect GmbH developed an innovative geothermal heat absorber system called “GeoCollector”. Project output is the ability to produce the current Prototype GeoCollectors (TRL 6/7) in a way meeting the identified market requirements:</Technology_Description></item>
<item><Technology_Description>Greenhouses in Europe and Mediterranean produce 30% of the EU’s fruits and vegetables. Growing irrigation water resource pressures are driving greenhouse growers to use of more efficient irrigation techniques, and of non-potable water sources. These lead to a strong need for irrigation water treatment (IWT), to eliminate water-borne plant and human pathogens, mitigate clogging by bio-foul and secure reliable and uniform irrigation, and improve water oxygenation. Our goal is to bring to market a novel irrigation water treatment (IWT) solution based on our technology breakthroughs in on-site generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Our autonomous H2O2 generation device (HPGen) enables the safe, cost-effective and sustainable on-site generation of hydrogen peroxide, with only water, air and electricity as input. Hydrogen peroxide is a potent but eco-friendly disinfection agent, yet its use in IWT is very limited due the costs, risks and complexities of its present-day supply chain. HPGen will disrupt today’s H2O2 supply chain, enabling growers to reap the benefits of its use in IWT, substantially decreasing IWT and irrigation line maintenance costs, eliminating use of toxic-chemicals in IWT, improving farm safety, and increasing crop yields. HPGen will provide farmers with a positive economic impact of €4k-€5k per hectare per annum, while enhancing agriculture sustainability and reducing environmental impact. Technology breakthrough was made at the Danish Technical University 5 years ago, and a commercialization path was launched 2 years ago by HPNow ApS, a Danish SME. The company has since been highly successful in scaling up its technology, while attracting strong commercial partners, including global leaders in agriculture irrigation and in bulk hydrogen peroxide production, which are actively supporting this project. This project will initiate with pilot and customer trials of a full-scale version (TRL 6), and will end with commercial launch of HPGen (TRL 9).</Technology_Description></item>

Contamination of water supplies by micropollutants such as metal ions, pesticides and pharmaceuticals is a major contributor to this water stress. These pollutants are released by industrial processes in the textile and manufacturing industries. Existing water treatment removes 99.96% of contaminants, but does not remove the 0.04% of micropollutants. Although the remaining contaminants seem small, they are a major problem as they are exceptionally difficult to capture but also highly toxic to humans and animals. CustoMem have developed a customisable selective nanocellulose media called CustoMem Granular Media (CGM) that is bioengineered to capture and remove all micropollutants including the 0.04% that cannot currently be removed.Customers benefit from a simple, low cost, low energy solution that is low maintenance. It allows removal of all micropollutants resulting in clean water supplies. The company is headquartered in the Imperial College Incubator UK and employ 5 full time employees and multiple subcontractors. The company is currently in talks with companies in the EU who have shown an active interest in the project.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>Polibiotech, an SME from Italy, has developed a patented advanced manufacturing process that successfully formulates any chemical compound quicker, at a lower cost and resource-efficiently. Current chemicals production procedures of wet and dry granulation have difficulties with universality, waste ingredients and energy consumption. Nutraceutical formulation requires repetitive research and testing to prove viability and is an extremely inefficient, time-consuming process (lasting up to several months). The Aerodynamic Granulation System (AGS) is a new process of dry granulation that revolutionises the formulation process and successfully manufactures any drug. The system uses a gas flow to optimise particle transportation and granule separation. The system is eco-sustainable as less raw materials are input and waste can be recycled through the use of a continuous process in a closed system. The AGS method reduces formulation time from several months to one day. At peak performance the AGS could produce more than one new formulation per week and a basic machine would have capacity to produce 1 tonne a day. The system concept will initially be applied to the nutraceutical markets; however, any product that requires the combination of chemicals to form a homogeneous compound can utilize this technique including the pharmaceutical market. An advanced prototype AGS has been constructed and trialled in an operational environment and a variety of products have been formulated. Within the overall project Polibiotech intend to: construct a second pilot plant in Italy; engineer a series of online quality control tests; validate the full scale AGS line for the production of nutraceutical compounds and gain certification for manufacturing roll out within the EU.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>Today the application of fertilisers to agricultural crops is mainly based on calculations, estimations and recommendations and not on analyses of the actual demand of soil and plants. The resulting over-fertilisation has substantial disadvantages: Farmers suffer from reduced yields and unnecessary expenses for fertilisers, groundwater is polluted, surface water bodies are eutrophicated, greenhouse gas is emitted from soils and finite natural fertiliser resources are depleted. It is estimated that up to 35 % of the applied fertiliser could be saved if a method for the quick and simple determination of the fertiliser demand existed.</Technology_Description></item>
<item><Technology_Description>The CEASELESS project will demonstrate how the new Sentinel measurements can support the development of a coastal dimension in Copernicus by providing an unprecedented level of resolution/ accuracy/continuity with respect to present products. The retrieval and validation for restricted domains and for an enlarged set of combined variables (user oriented) will be the basis to advance the state of the art in assimilation, modelling and applications, at a level commensurate with the new Sentinel capabilities. The project will address the multiple scales coexisting in littoral areas by developing new shallow water parameterizations, introducing them into coupled model suites (wind-wave-surge-current-land discharge) and producing new standards for coastal simulations and analyses. The permanent data base, with dynamic repositories, plus the modular structure of the developed models will demonstrate the technical feasibility of a future operational Copernicus coastal service. The set of derived products will be ingested into the users’ work routines, proving the economic feasibility of the Copernicus coastal extension. The level of conflicts in squeezed coastal zones, expected to grow in the face of climate change, will, thus, benefit directly from CEASELESS, establishing tangible contributions for a wide range of economic sectors. The data repositories (accessible via a dedicated portal), regularly updated with the evolving (satellite-derived) bathymetry will facilitate the use/re-use of our high resolution results, supporting a new set of Copernicus coastal applications such as renewable energy, coastal erosion or harbour exploitation. The mutual validation of satellite data, numerical results and in-situ observations will generate reciprocal profit for enhanced competiveness of EU coastal industries where we shall also explore the suitability for cases in 3rd countries, opening new business opportunities for a coastal Copernicus.</Technology_Description></item>
<item><Technology_Description>The longer offshore distances of subsea facilities of Oil&amp;Gas rigs are now placed further than decades ago, and inability to power the instrumentations that they require may lead to an economic loss of billions of euros. The power can be supplied through a subsea power and umbilical communication or turbo generators connected to a battery. Yet, these alternatives are very expensive and can be low efficient. The use of renewable energies set near the consumer (off-shore wind, solar or wave energy) seem to be a feasible alternative, but their availability is intermittent and present high capital and operational Costs.  To solve these issues, born from the idea of Current2Current founders –experienced project managers in subsea oilfield for BP Ltd. projects, we have been working on SUBPORT project since 2007. We have developed a compact and simple tidal turbine that can work with flow from any direction, with current speeds &lt; 0.5 m/s, and stable under any water depth and current speed.

<item><Technology_Description>In Europe, it is estimated that water distribution networks lose around 30-40% of treated water; reaching over 50% in some Eastern European countries. Typically, distribution losses (5%-50%) are much larger than production losses (2%-10%), so it is important to focus on a solution for the first ones. One million miles of pipes beneath our streets need to be replaced as some have over 100 years, which lead to potential problems such as the collapse of a pipeline or damages to nearby assets.Leakage levels can be reduced implementing leakage control programs, but these are costly (av. 1,100€/Km sewer repair) and have associated time-loss between water leak and technical assistance (2 days). Also the difficult access to pipelines can increase these costs. Water suppliers need to optimize investments on leak management in order to reduce annual leaks while minimizing operational and capital costs.The Italian SME Sipe S.r.l. is developing NOLEAK, a new smart system based on a revolutionary self-powered device (saving 50kW/h) that detects water leaks in supply mains. The system immediately alerts the water distributor or home user, and it automatically activates a self-repairing system capable of checking that the leak has been fixed. Furthermore, NOLEAK is able to alert if water is being used in an incorrect manner (e.g., a damaged tap or valve) making the final user/operator more conscious about water consumption/management. This smart system will reduce up to 30% water loss during distribution.NOLEAK has been designed to operate in continuous mode and provides daily updates of water consumption profiles. This information can be sent to water managers and/or consumers via internet, reducing managing costs (20-35%) of operators that have to manually check water consumptions every month. Our wide range of target customers includes water service providers, private water companies, individual households, water professionals, and small businesses.</Technology_Description></item>
<item><Technology_Description>In order to meet the rising water demand required by an expanding population, which has already crossed the 7 billion mark and is expected to reach 8,5 billion by 2030, and 9,7 billion in 2050, desalination of seawater is envisaged as a solution to provide a portion of the shortfall to fill the gap between supply and demand. Desalination becomes in many parts of the world, and also in Europe, a promising option to combat water stress. Nonetheless, desalination plants generate huge volumes of concentrates, also known as brines, which represent a potential hazard for marine ecosystems. Brines form a very dense hypersaline plume (heavier than normal seawater) that spreads over large areas affecting marine ecosystems, especially to seagrass meadows which are one of the most ecologically important ecosystems in coastal areas. ECOS has developed VENTURI+ a diffuser solution, with a capacity of minimizing in a 99% the environmental impact associated to brines discharges due to a potential dilution capacity 131% higher than conventional diffusers. Thus, VENTURI+ represents a technological leap towards tackling one of the most robust environmental barriers that are holding the full deployment of desalination plants.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>Three out of four people in EU drink water from groundwater subjected to severe nitrate contamination by fertilizers and sanitary products used in intensive agriculture &amp; farming. High levels of nitrates in drinking water put human health at risk and have been reported to threaten 26% of EU biodiversity. Current technologies do not meet the needs of small water suppliers, who must face costs derived from high energy consumption (3-7 kWh/m3), poor nitrate selectivity, residual streams and by-products, and continuous costly maintenance. 33% of suppliers in Europe are not compliant with quality standards, particularly nitrate levels. ZIRONITRO is the result of 8 years of research and development by Ofra Aqua Plants, an Israeli company with over 25 years’ experience in bioengineering and phytoremediation. Based on the concept of using nature to cleanse nature, ZIRONITRO is a constructed wetland to biologically treat groundwater by removing nitrates to obtain high-quality drinking water (98% removal), at 84% lower cost than current. ZIRONITRO’s innovation resides in the system’s nitrate removal specificity, with a design that allows low-cost operation and maintenance, along with very high rates of nitrate breakdown by bacteria. The key factor is the selection of the best combination of both bacteria and plants, along with the optimal proportion of methanol as carbon source. The particular environment we have generated inside our ponds reduces hydraulic retention time by 90% and uses 100 times less ethanol than current constructed wetlands. Indeed, we do not use synthetic chemicals, energy input needed is negligible, and neither residuals nor wastewater are generated, so it has no negative impact on the environment. On the contrary, it contributes to both biodiversity conservation and landscape value. For 2020-2022, we forecast €61.3 M cumulative revenues (profitability ratio of 12%), increasing workforce to 40 people.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>Agricultural technology is among the most revolutionary and impactful areas of modern technology driven by the fundamental need for feeding an ever-growing population. Its development has to serve the agriculture that is environmentally sustainable and cost competitive. That means fewer pesticides application, less water consumption and more efficient use of machines. Excessive use of pesticides for the suppression of insect pests, diseases and weeds has significant impact on the human health and environment. It is estimated that about 50% of all pesticides applied do not reach their intended target consequently increasing negative impact on environment, but also production costs thus implying that application of pesticides have to bedone with higher accuracy. Agriculture production cost is furthermore burdened by high cost of crop protection, particularly in grapes and other fruits growth. In permanent and close cooperation with fruit growers TEYME has recognized the mentioned challenges and developed technology to enable reducing the use and negative impact of pesticide. TEYME has improved the existing state of the art pneumatic sprayers for vineyards by patented spraying technology supported by guidance system based on video input. The control system is capable of controlling the spraying rate of individual spraying nozzles based on video input algorithms. Machine vision algorithms are providing information about canopy, foliage density and all necessary data that not only guide the process of spraying but also provide vital data for farmer such as growth rate and health status of the vineyard.

<item><Technology_Description>"Flying SpArk is a food technology company which focuses on finding new ways of incorporating insect protein into food products for human consumption to support access to alternative protein sources as well as to increase food supply. Insects, even though less popular in the Western world, have been a part of diets of many peoples in various regions around the world for centuries. Flying SpArk’s protein powder made of the Mediterranean fruit fly, has many clear advantages to other sources of protein. Among these they have a better nutritional value compared to animal and non-animal derived proteins as well as other insects. Moreover, insects have a higher feed conversion efficiency than animals, for example, every 10kg of feed provides 1kg of beef and 5kg of chicken, compared to 8-9kg of insects. Flying SpArk’s edge lies in the selection of the insect for production of the protein powder: the Mediterranean fruit fly, which has never been used for human consumption before. It is more efficient in farming and feeding in relation to the amount and quality of the protein product in comparison to e.g. crickets, locusts, and even more compared to livestock, and it is less expensive also to the consumers. Fruit flies are also cholesterol, antibiotic, hormone, and pesticide free. Their farming requires relatively less resources as they require much less water and feed, and produce less waste, manure, and methane than conventional livestock. Flying SpArk’s innovative project provides an opportunity to address relevant challenges faced by European societies – mainly related to provide adequate supply for high-quality food while enhancing innovation and sustainability in production processes. By using food waste in the fruit flies’ diet Flying SpArk contributes to "closing the loop" of food lifecycles through re-use, and bring benefits for both the environment and the economy."</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>In recent years, a growing concern has been expressed throughout EU regarding the use of phytosanitary products in agricultural activities and the significant impacts this practice may have on the environment and on users and consumers’ health. Conventional pesticides are synthetic materials that directly kill or inactivate the pest mainly produced from non-renewable resources. There is an increasing demand for residue-free crop protection products, which lesser or none negative impact on environment and better safety features such as biopesticides which are naturally occurring substances that control pests by non-toxic mechanisms, more efficient and formulated to specifically affect a concrete target pest, in contrast to the broad spectrum of conventional pesticides that may affect many other organisms as birds, insects and mammals through the food chain. When used as a component of the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) and Integrated Crop Management (ICM) programs, biopesticides can greatly decrease the use of conventional ones, while not affecting the crop yields.  Biopesticides are also suitable for Organic Agriculture. The BLOSTER project aims to produce different kinds of biopesticides, showing clearly economic (competitiveness in price, creation of market opportunities for the proposer company KIMITEC and other European plant growers and green residues’ suppliers, encouragement of farmers’ competitiveness at global level), quality (R&amp;D based solutions tested and validated following a pharmacological approach, controlled high quality raw material), safety (less use of chemical products, benefiting EU consumers and farmers at international level) and environmental (better use of natural resources with regards to the raw material used (W2R), less impact on the biodiversity, soil, water and air, less ecological footprint by avoiding raw material transport from third countries, is it will be produced in EU) advantages against the current conventional pesticides.</Technology_Description></item>

Unlike its competitors, it is easily implemented in quot;new buildquot; and quot;on the waterquot; ships adapting to its size limitations, since it is mounted in the diesel engine housing and rapidly integrated in the propulsion system shaft line ​without changes in the propulsion system configuration. AuxiliaTM has been developed by Realizzazioni Tecniche Navalmeccaniche (RTN) an Italian SME with more than 48 year experience in marine propulsion. This innovation has been possible thanks to technical advances in electric motors and a special clutch type designed and developed by RTN.AuxiliaTM substantially saves fuel, fulfils current and upcoming environmental regulations even in restricted areas, lowers main engine maintenance, significantly improves manoeuvring in harbours and workplaces (fundamental for off-shore crafts, tug boats, etc.) and makes noise and vibrations negligent. The proposed project will be profitable in the period 2019-2023 (IRR of 32.43%) with a payback period of 3.2 years.</Technology_Description></item>
<item><Technology_Description>Methanol represents one of the most common and widespread platform chemicals and precursors for further synthesis, and is traditionally produced from synthesis gas, obtained by the reforming of natural gas. This methanol synthesis process operates in a stable, high-throughput manner and demands low carbon dioxide/carbon monoxide ratios in feed. The current project, nonetheless, is to encompass flexible (in operation and feed) methanol synthesis with high carbon dioxide concentration-streams as an input, the latter originating from thermal power stations using fossil fuels. The demonstrational technology may alternatively be intended for the application of existing biomass combustion and gasification system streams, operating for the production of electric/thermal energy, as opposed to chemical synthesis. The other synthesis reactant, hydrogen, is to originate from water hydrolysis using surplus energy, which would be conversely difficult to return to the grid. The three main benefits of the process would thus be as follows; the mitigation of exhaust carbon dioxide and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (1), stabilisation of electric grid by the consumption of the electric energy at its peaks (2), and the production of methanol as a versatile chemical for further conversion (3). Implications of such technology would have a strong connection to the pending exploration of alternative energy carriers and their synthesis as opposed to conventional resources of fuels and chemicals. The principal technological challenge to be overcome is anticipated to be the development of a suitable catalyst and process, which would allow for high-CO2-content feeds, relatively transient operation (save for an upstream buffering technology is developed), and economically viable operating conditions. The primary advantages of this technology are to be its flexibility, medium-scale operation (deployed “at exhaust location”), and facile integration capacities.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>Air Pollution is the world’s worst environmental health risk: 7 million people die every year as a result of air pollution exposure. 2 billion children live in areas where outdoor air pollution exceeds the established thresholds. From an economic point of view, the costs derived from health impacts and mortality from air pollution are increasing every year: in Europe the overall annual economic cost is estimated at €1,200 billion. Current strategies for improving air quality focuses in control mechanisms but they do not tackle directly the problem of eliminating the pollutants present in the air. The MossTree is a 4 meter-high 3m-wide and 60cm deep, freestanding unit, which contains combi planting of specific moss cultures and vascular plants that eat particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide and ozone – together offsetting 240 t CO2e/ year. The construction contains smart sensors collecting environmental as well as climatic data, to regulate and control the unit and ensure that the moss culture survives. Thus, the MossTree has the same effect as 275 normal urban trees, but requires 99% less space and 90% less investment. Every MossTree has a capacity to clean the air in a proximity of up to 50m. Thanks to solar panels and rain water retention systems, the unit requires less than 10 hours of maintenance per year. Furthermore, our solution allows digital and visual information transmission through e.g. WiFi, iBeacon and NFC for the purpose of sponsored messages and advertising. Finally, thanks to the sensors incorporated that permanently monitor the air quality the tree will become an important smart city climate infrastructure. After having successfully commercialized the first version of our solution in 9 different cities worldwide, the new version of the MossTree will allow us to obtain a cumulative revenue of €200 million in the period 2019-2021, open new offices in other UE countries and Asia, and create up to 100 new positions.</Technology_Description></item>
<item><Technology_Description>Almost half of the fruits and vegetables production is lost before it is consumed by people. Dehydration is considered the main driver of quality decrease and promoter of fungi/bacteria proliferation. Taking into account that contamination occurs due to water loss and the action of fungi/bacteria, the reduction of the product shelf-life can be summarized as the combination of the above factors.  Consequently, marketing of products that have suffered significant water loss and spoilage becomes difficult; therefore key participants on the post-harvest sector is on demand of solutions able to extend the shelf-life of fruits and vegetables and thus increase the profitability of their activities.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>Established process for the manufacture of ceramic parts involve the key step of mixing in the wet state, and controlled drying (also called atomization) through Spray Dryer equipment. It can guarantee the absolute control in the size and shape of the particles, and their residual degree of humidity. The advantages, making this a fundamental step in the ceramic industry, are related to the flowing capacity of the spray-dried granules, permitting the process at high speed and control over the final performances of the products. As a drawback, this is recognized as one of the most energy intensive steps in the ceramic process, due to the massive evaporation of water and the use of compressed air, almost equivalent to the sintering at high temperature. Early results of independent research conducted from DAXEL, in cooperation with a private laboratory in Italy, have brought to the awareness that it can be avoided, through the implementation into a dry-mixing process of fluidizing agents, permitting the granulated powders to reach an equivalent level of fluidity, and therefore enabling equivalent speed of processing. The advantages DAXEL can provide to its ceramic processor customers are the reduction of one energy intensive step, the reduction of capital investments at no modification of the final quality. Technological Feasibility, Market Assessment, Business Models and Plans are the objectives of the DryMix project, oriented to permit the implementation of the project results into real business cases.

<item><Technology_Description>The WiMUST (Widely scalable Mobile Underwater Sonar Technology) project aims at expanding and improving the functionalities of current cooperative marine robotic systems, effectively enabling distributed acoustic array technologies for geophysical surveying with a view to exploration and geotechnical applications. Recent developments have shown that there is vast potential for groups of marine robots acting in cooperation to drastically improve the methods available for ocean exploration and exploitation. Traditionally, seismic reflection surveying is performed by vessel towed streamers of hydrophones acquiring reflected acoustic signals generated by acoustic sources (either towed or onboard a vessel). In this context, geotechnical surveying for civil and commercial applications (e.g., underwater construction, infrastructure monitoring, mapping for natural hazard assessment, environmental mapping, etc.) aims at seafloor and sub-bottom characterization using towed streamers of fixed length that are extremely cumbersome to operate. The vision underlying the WiMUST proposal is that of developing advanced cooperative and networked control / navigation systems to enable a large number (tens) of marine robots (both on the surface and submerged) to interact by sharing information as a coordinated team (not only in pairs). The WiMUST system may be envisioned as an adaptive variable geometry acoustic array. By allowing the group of surface and submerged vehicles to change their geometrical configuration, an end-user can seamlessly change the geometry of the ”virtual streamer” trailing the emitter, something that has not been achieved in practice and holds potential to drastically improve ocean surveying. The project brings together a group of research institutions, geophysical surveying companies and SMEs with a proven track record in autonomous adaptive and robust systems, communications, networked cooperative control and navigation, and marine robot design and fabrication.</Technology_Description></item>

Climate change is shortening the ski season because of less snow precipitation and of higher average winter temperature. Ski resorts have to counteract the lack of natural snow, and to guarantee the opening of ski district in the most touristic periods. Current snowmaking techniques (fans and cannons) require an air temperature below 0°C and low humidity, thus are not applicable for large part of the season. NeveXN developed a technology able to produce high quality snow at temperatures above 0°, in all weather condition and without any chemical additives. SnowRESolution is a clean-tech snowmaker that works also when traditional snowmakers cannot be operated. The technology is based on the refrigeration cycle and exploits the triple point of water, a condition that occurs at 0°C and almost in vacuum (6mbar) at which the three phases of ice, liquid, and vapour are in equilibrium. The compressor is driven by thermal energy that is provided by renewable energy sources, which may be either a solar thermal collector or a biomass steam boiler. Winter tourism is very important in all mountain regions, and risk to undergo to huge losses if slopes are bare. SnowRESolution address the market of ski resorts that want to guarantee the production of snow also when ambient temperature is above 0°C, enabling an early opening of the ski season. Interest savings opportunities are offered to ski domes that do no need any additional cooling to produce snow and can chose the solar power supply solution.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>Wind power has established itself in recent years as a clean alternative to conventional sources of electrical generation.Reduced costs and wider deployment, especially in the European market, have led over the past decade to its use at sea. Here, the wind resource is larger and more constant, allowing higher unitary power turbines. However, the marine environment itself also imposes a number of restrictions and challenges. The technology that is being deployed now is fixed to the seabed, using different types of foundations, but a large amount of wind resources is in deeper waters, where floating solutions are needed. Because of their initial higher costs, these solutions are still under development, with only three prototypes installed worldwide. The challenge nowadays is to reduce the costs of floating wind turbine structures that will ease the access to a much larger energy potential than available in land, more easily manageable and with lower visual impact. The aim of the SATH project is the demonstration in real conditions of a floating structure for offshore wind which will allow a reduction in LCOE (Levelized Cost Of Energy) over the current floating technology. To achieve this, it is proposed as a first objective the validation and qualifying for this technology, of a 1:3 scaled prototype not only from a technical point of view but also from economic and necessary logistics. The SATH solution is a platform that consists of two cylindrical floats (of prestressed reinforced concrete) which can be manufactured onshore and transported and positioned at the final location in a single mooring point allowing the rotation of the platform around, self-aligning with the wind direction.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>CONTEXT: Water shortages and water pollution constitute major environmental threats in the EU. European agriculture occupies 40% of the land and can reach up to an 80% of total water abstraction and it’s the main responsible of nutrient soil pollution.</Technology_Description></item>
<item><Technology_Description>Agricultural farm holdings count up to over 12 million farms in EU-28 countries with almost 10 million directly employed labour force. Most of these farms are small to medium sized farms. In the EU live 23.5 million cows and 152 million pigs. Producing pig meat and dairy products are energy intensive processes whose energy consumption makes up to 16% of the whole consumption in the agricultural sector. Apart from being energy intensive sectors, these animals produce large quantities of waste.  KUDURA is a disruptive portable solution for waste - to -energy and water treatment, which operates off-grid, which use transforms  cow and pig manure waste into biogas to feed a combined heat and power plant to obtain electricity and heat.

<item><Technology_Description>The topic of this proposal is to determine the final production model of a scooping-device that allows non-amphibious conventional airtankers to scoop water from a body of water (sea, lake, river or a dam-reservoir) flying at an altitude of +/- 10 metres, in order to suppress forest fires much more quicker by 5 times. Today only dedicated amphibious airtankers, like the so-called Canadairs CL 415, can scoop water. Non-amphibious conventional airtankers have to return to the airport to refill with loss of time. Today such a scooping device (Scodev) does not exist and it will be a revolution in forestfire combating industry, thus it is disruptive. Feasibility studies have shown that it is possible to scoop large amounts of water in very brief time of 15 seconds. Prototype flying tests will prove this ability and serve as mandatory application procedure for EASA airworthiness certification. Once the prototype tests are finished, the Scodev is ready for the market. With the patented Scodev, operators of airtankers will improve their dropping-capacity from 1 to 5 droppings per hour. By improving the dropping capacity with 5 times, the suppression-efficiency will improve exponentially up to 8 times, which means that the damage will be reduced between 50 and 80 %. Today worldwide there are only 110 amphibious Canadairs. There are 1200 non-amphibious airtankers, owned by civil protection entities or forest service bodies. In addition there are 1500 large military aircrafts for disaster relief, and 1500 small airtankers SEAT. Meaning the potential is very big and the trend is increasing due to global warming. Due to forest fires millions of hectares are lost and the financial damage is hundreds of billions of Euros. The use of the Scodev will decrease not only financial losses, but the environmental and ecological damages will also be radically reduced.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>Despite the encouraging scenario of Wide Solar Thermal Electricity market - it is a reality today with 4.9 GW in operation worldwide in 2015, forecasting 260 GW in 2030, 664GW in 2040 and finally to reach a 12% of total electricity generation by 2050 (982 GW) - CSP growth has been slower than expected because several issues have not been overcome yet. It is not as cost-efficient as other technologies making difficult its access to the generation mix. Another not-solved aspect is flexibility, since one of the main issues of the electrical market is the complexity to match the supply and demand curves due to the arbitrariness of the sun. Finally, CSP technology brings environmental issues related to the usage of oil sinthetic as HTF and a meaningful water consumption. In this framework, MSLOOP 2.0 aims to validate a business opportunity consisting of developing a cost effective solar field for CSP Parabolic Trough Power Plants using optimized ternary molten salts as HTF with an innovative hybridization system. The result of the project will be a new solution of CSP commercial plant with at least a 20 % LCOE reduction and flexibility improvement providing firm and dispatchable electricity based on a disruptive and environmentally friendly innovation. MSLOOP 2.0 will ensure the market-drivers acceptance from the beginning of the project in order to launch the solution in open tenders in less of 6 months after the project final, boosting significant contributions to industry, environment and society and that will make possible a deep penetration of CSP plants in the generation mix increasing the share of renewables.  In order to achieve this challenge, the MSLOOP 2.0 consortium consists of a multidisciplinary team formed by 5 partners from 3 European Union member countries in strategic fields within solar thermal sector. This composition will boost an innovative development capable of achieving a strong positioning in the market.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>The world fleet consumes up to 325 million tonnes of fuel/ year, being responsible for the emission of 1,099 million tonnes of greenhouse gas (GHG). Ships only use 28% of the energy from the fuel to generate propulsion, of which the majority is spent overcoming fouling. Thus, keeping the hull clean can result in significant cost savings and reduce the GHG emissions. Currently, when the ship performance decreases significantly a call on-demand underwater service for removal or killing of the fouling is contracted. This is performed when the ship is docked using diver- or unmanned-operated vehicles. These solutions have often poor quality, are expensive, unsafe for the divers and/ or maritime traffic and only provide a transient increase in the hull performance. </Technology_Description></item>
<item><Technology_Description>ERSO is an Austrian company specialising in the research and development of novel technologies within the energy sector to reduce global energy consumption. Skiing demand has reached almost 400 million visits globally per annum and with over 7000 indoor ice rinks the demand for artificial snow/ice is great. With the rise of global temperatures and the unpredictability of weather conditions the rise in ski resorts limiting the amount of natural snow available, the introduction of artificial snow has been a method of extending the ski season to accommodate further visitors. Some ski resorts in Switzerland, Austria and Italy use artificial snow for 50% or more of their skiing area and the water consumption for this can be up to 20% of an entire regions water usage for a year. Traditional methods of producing artificial snow have a number of disadvantages and environmental effects such as high production costs, short snow lifetime, short temperature range and the damage of the wildlife and fauna. Often, to make good quality snow, water is mixed with either dust or bacteria, of which both can cause damage to the ecosystem when the snow eventually melts. With the huge volumes of water used, the melting process can also lead to instability within the summer season of the ground and can lead to landslides and the destruction of flora. ERSO have identified a business opportunity and have developed technology which restructures the water itself making it more compact and therefore have a longer lifetime which reduces water and energy consumption as well as the environmental effects of artificial snow production. The SnowTech system allows the snow/ice produced to resist melting for up to 30% longer which also means snow can be produced at higher temperatures (up to 2 °C), reduces costs to ~30%. For a ski resort with 10 km of artificial snow slope we can allow savings of up to 1,000,000 L of water, 160,000 kWh of energy and €44,000 in cost solely attributed to electricity.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>ACIES BIO has developed an innovative and disruptive high-value technology to address a major economical and environmental challenge of the world’s dairy industry: waste whey. Over 200 million tons of whey is generated annually, and only limited economical solutions exist to process it. The innovative patent pending technology Whey2Value uses a unique bioprocess to utilize whey as a primary ingredient for microbial fermentation to produce sustainable high-value products, such as vitamin B12. The technology greatly reduces the negative impact on the environment by almost eliminating the organic content of the wastewater, allowing for its recycling, while the product of the technology is a protein-rich biomass with high content of vitamin B12 to be used as a very high quality animal feed to complete the dairy industry’s circle. The innovation W2V is perfect example of how circular economy should work. The Whey2Value technology requires a very low-cost processing facility, which can be installed on site, and minimal maintenance costs. It represents a truly unique opportunity to create a huge and disruptive impact on dairy industry, particularly for the competitiveness of small and medium sized European dairy companies, generating high-value products from waste material, and at the same time creating a sustainable solution with a greatly reduced burden to the environment. The objective of this project proposal is to prepare a thorough business plan and feasibility study in the scope of Phase 1, followed by scaling-up and demonstration of operational technology in industrial setting with a local dairy company in the scope of Phase 2.

<item><Technology_Description>NVP Energy presents the first to market, high-rate anaerobic digestion (AD) technology that successfully treats low strength wastewater (WW) at ambient temperatures (&lt; 20°C). The low-temperature (Lt-AD) process provides a novel solution to Food and Drinks industrial sectors producing large WW volumes requiring treatment. The sector of interest is milk treatment and processing, a growing market producing over 367 billion litres annually; WW is typically treated using conventional aerobic processes resulting in high sludge yields, requiring a large footprint on-site and a heavy reliance on fossil fuels. Lt-AD produces negligible sludge volumes, has a compact design, requires no heat input or biogas recirculation, and produces effluent of urban wastewater directive (UWWD) standard (&lt; 125 mg/L COD) without post-aeration. A typical dairy processing plant producing 5,000 m3 WW per day can save 97% on operational costs by replacing aerobic treatment with Lt-AD, and generate annual biogas revenue of €616,266.

<item><Technology_Description>Uncertainties in water availability, rising fertilizer and energy costs and increasing demand for renewable raw materials impose serious challenges on the primary sector with far-reaching implications. Irrigation practices put more and more pressure on scarce freshwater resources and mineral fertilizers are often overused leading to environmental problems and heavy impacts on the production costs of producers. Increasing resource efficiency, productivity and competitiveness of agricultural practitioners are crucial for addressing the aforementioned societal challenges. Fertigation, a novel concept merging irrigation and fertilization to one process, poses an innovative alternative to conventional cultivation practices. Hydro-Air, as SME in irrigation technology development and provision, developed and integrated the concept of fertigation with pivot- and linear irrigation systems. Using GPS &amp; GIS data in conjunction with sensor based soil and crop property parameters the SMART Fertigation system enables sub area specific farmland management and fertigation. Optimised resource application leads to an immense savings potential in production costs (water &amp; fertilizer by 20%) besides increasing crop yield from growth phase adjusted water and nutrient supply. This ‘saving &amp; gaining’ makes Hydro-Air confident to supply an internationally growing market demand for resource efficient, green technologies. Based on encouraging results in field trials Hydro-Air prepares advances towards market introduction. Hydro-Air will apply and use the funding in Phase 1 to conduct a feasibility study which will reveal the European market potential of SMART Fertigation. Client groups in targeted countries will be evaluated and a business plan will developed considering estimated costs and revenues including return of investment schemes. The results and experiences will feed into the continuous improvement of the SMART Fertigation system preparing for subsequent development phases.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>Sea-More-Yield is a revolutionary non-transgenic platform for trait introduction via single 1.5L/Ha foliar spray, enabling immediate expression of desirable anti-shatter traits in OSR. This pioneering technology enables growers for the first time to modulate OSR pod physiology to minimise seed loss and yield risk with an early season spray (in the absence of pods). With a global population set to reach 9 billion by 2050, OSR is a key crop for human and animal consumption and is central to mitigating a future food and/or energy security crisis. OSR due to its relatively recent domestication suffers from a number of defects which limits its success as a modern day crop. Fully mature pods of oilseed rape are extremely prone to opening, resulting in seed loss (pod shatter). Typical losses vary between 15% and 25% of the potential yield, but reductions of up to 50% were estimated in seasons when weather conditions were poor prior to and during harvest. A reduction in the tendency of pods to opening is the number one trait sought by farmers and would serve to increase the proportion of the yield recovered by the combine harvester and thereby improve production efficiency and sustainability of OSR as alternative food and energy source. To address this industry-limiting problem, SMY offers a unique blue technology that modulates OSR pod physiology to control unsynchronized pod shatter leading to recovery of an additional 20% of the yield potential.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>There is a huge number of small and medium sized sewage plants in and out of the European Union that cannot pass over urban sewage sludge for agricultural use in sufficient proportion (less than 50% in the EU), therefore the management of these sewage plants usually ask and receive permissions from environmental authorities for disposing the communal sludge in disused mines or dumps. Instead of disposal/landfilling – that regularly causes pollution of natural water resources – it would be more beneficial to produce sludge pellets. Such experiences drove us to create the InnoPellet technology, a self-supporting biofuel pellet producing system for treating communal sewage sludge that is economical in case of small scale production too. </Technology_Description></item>
<item><Technology_Description>No need for heat! NVP Energy presents the first to market, high-rate AD technology that successfully treats low strength wastewater (WW) at ambient temperatures (4 - 20°C). The low-temperature anaerobic digestion (Lt-AD) process provides a novel solution to Food and Drinks industrial sectors which produce large volumes of WW. The European milk treatment and processing sector alone generates over 367 billion litres annually which is typically treated using conventional aerobic processes. The latter treatment process is unsustainable. It results in high sludge yields, requires a large footprint on-site and is hugely reliant on fossil fuels for aeration. The Lt-AD technology produces negligible sludge volumes, presents a compact design, requires no heat input or biogas recirculation, and produces effluent of urban wastewater directive (UWWD) standard (&lt; 125 mg/L COD) without post-aeration. Comparing Lt-AD to conventional aerobic treatment of WW from a typical dairy processing plant producing 2,000 m3 WW per day, Lt-AD can provide annual OPEX savings of €1,662,106 p.a over a payback period of 2.49 years that includes RHI revenue of €374,176. The low temperature operation of Lt-AD allows for 100% of the biogas produced being available for reuse or resale. Lt-AD also has a high impact on environmental savings through reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and lowered thermal energy and fossil fuels requirements.  This Phase 2 project will allow NVP Energy install and commission a demonstrator plant and gain 8-12 months operational data. The results obtained, in conjunction with ETV assessment, will build the business case for each targeted market channel ahead of commercialisation. Other key project objectives include: commercialisation partner relationship development; promotional materials development; exploitation planned; assessment and protection of IP assets and project risk management.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>The most important innovation in marine fish aquaculture is the improvement of survival rate and development during the larval stage of the fish. Reasons are that the current nutritional quality of most common live food organisms (rotifers and Artemia nauplii) is inadequate leading to high mortality, deformations and sub-optimal growth during the larval phase of these fish species which limit the overall production. </Technology_Description></item>
<item><Technology_Description>The SME Planktonic has succeeded in cryopreserving marine crustacean nauplii (hereafter called CryoProduct) in large user-friendly entities, and to revive them as live individuals after thawing. The ease-of-use CryoProduct meets the nutritional requirements of fish larvae. A doubling in growth rate and a 25-30% shortening of the live feed period compared to a diet of the suboptimal live feed diets commonly used at marine hatcheries have been demonstrated (large-scale industrial trial, TRL6). With a well-functioning feeding protocol to be developed in the project period, it is expected that performances of the fish larvae will be even better. It will be put effort on optimizing the cryopreservation protocols to achieve a CryoProduct with even better quality than today for improving the performances of fish juveniles. A bio-security evaluation will be performed, and a screening of microorganisms will be needed for the registration of the CryoProduct. To successfully launch the CryoProduct into the EU market, it will be of major importance to scale up the production, to establish efficient logistic systems, identify end-users needs and to provide a reliable commercialisation plan for the best possible market introduction. As the CryoProduct has outstanding performances compared to today’s alternatives, we expect a market share of 50% of the live feed market on a longer term. This corresponds to a revenue of more than 100 million €. As the market grows 3-4% per year, the market size will double in about 20 years. It is a considerable aquaculture production in the EU. If the product meet the expectations, it will most probably be a major contribution to realize the production potential of marine fish in aquaculture in the EU. This will result in many thousand new jobs, and primarily in the Mediterranean region. The business innovation project fits well to the business strategy of Planktonic, and to the Horizon2020 SME-2 programme under the topic BG-12-2015.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>The total global water demand is expected to rise by 35–60% until 2025 compared to the level of the year 2000, and could then double by 2050. Already today, Europe’s Mediterranean regions suffer from water scarcity and thereof foremost the food sector, accounting for 80% of freshwater demand while representing a decisive economic factor in that regions. Depending strongly on secure and sustainable water supply, green technologies for water treatment are needed to safeguard its economic prosperity. Against this background WTS has developed an innovative, energy-efficient and sustainable technology for decentralised seawater desalination to generate high-quality potable water cost-efficiently (by using special high performance heat exchanger technology) and environmentally-friendly (using waste heat as energy input and avoiding salt pollution). The system provided in a sea container is portable and easily scalable imitating a weather-like cycle. The WTS solution is advantageous related to state of the art technology w.r.t. energy use, environmental burden and costs. The key market application is decentralized water production for users or user groups with the need to consume water directly on site but face limitation on available freshwater resources (due to large distances or over-exploitation). The idea is to offer small-scale, distributed desalination for the extraction of raw water from saline water sources for 1) drinking water production and 2) process water production. It will be viable to use the WTS technology in Mediterranean coastal areas and islands. The global capacity of desalination plants is expected to grow with a CAGR of 11%. The project helps safeguard sustainability and secure food production in the Mediterranean countries and other water stressed regions. Objective is to assess the technical feasibility of Water4Food in relevant industrial environment as well as the economic justification in the first target markets (Greece, Cyprus, Malta).</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>Naturbo is a breakthrough air-cleaning technology that boosts over hundred times green walls’ air-purifying capacities, making plants clean everything traditional air filters can’t. A green wall is a wall covered with greenery that includes a water delivery system and a growing medium. The Naturbo process happens here, in the growth medium, where the plants’ roots are located. NaturVention has designed an active green wall that exploits the Naturbo technology absorbing the air impurities in the root zone of the plants to transform them by breaking them down into nutrients for the plants. This enables the replacement of the synthetic chemicals and microbes in the indoor air with nature’s own healthy chemicals. A Naturbo-powered green wall provides offices, schools, hospitals and many other indoor facilities, with the best possible indoor air quality. The effectiveness of this process is amazing: e.g., one single Naturbo green wall device has the air cleaning capacity of over 8000 houseplants, naturalizing a space the size of an average classroom. No ordinary green wall is capable of doing the same. Artificial intelligence remotely controls the Naturbo’s operation and its environment via remote connection to a cloud server. Thus, Naturbo’s functions are constantly adjustable when conditions like temperature or seasons change. This way, people in the space always have the best possible indoor air quality: the fresh and healthy air of the virgin Finnish forests is brought to thousands European city dwellers.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>The growing world population and the change in dietary patterns will dramatically increase the demand for food and feed, which will turn into a greater use of water, agriculture’s primary production factor. In a context exacerbated by the ongoing climate change, which results in farmers’ increasing need to irrigate cost-efficiently to stay competitive, policy makers around the globe are striving to implement strategies and new technologies for better use and conservation of water resources. However, while the introduction of new drip and sprinkler-based irrigation practices allowed substantial water savings, these came at the expenses of an increase of energy consumption and capital expenditure, making modernized irrigation less profitable. Leveraging on the successful launch of the Barsha Pump, a floating river pump for small-scale farmers throughout the world, which does not require any fuel, electricity to operate, aQysta will develop and demonstrate a large-scale system for canals (with a power of 1.5 kW, compared to 150 W for floating river pumps) that can serve the needs of irrigation communities in Europe. This will be achieved by integrating the patent-pending Barsha Pump with the Hydrostatic Pressure Wheel concept, which is up to 90% efficient, compared to only 29.6% maximum efficiency of floating waterwheels and has been successfully proven as a prototype in both lab conditions and in field. This novel HyPump system will be designed as a size-scalable concept, allowing for several variants according to the specific needs of the targeted customers in Europe, and will allow users to benefit from up to 6-times increase in agricultural yield (compared to rain-fed irrigation) and up to 70% savings on operating costs with respect to standard fuel or electric pumps. Furthermore, the proposed solution will drastically reduce the environmental footprint with respect to conventional pumps and is at least 2 times less capital intensive compared to solar alternative.</Technology_Description></item>
<item><Technology_Description>The IceChilling project will demonstrate an enhanced cooling system as an add-on solution for the air chilling and spray chilling methods current used by most poultry meat processors. Food safety and quality are the main concerns of consumers who demand more fresh foods, longer shelf-life and safer foods. Western consumers eat 30-50 kg of chicken meat per person/year and they prefer fresh meat over frozen. As up to 75% of chickens are contaminated with Camphylobacter, this is a major concern and challenge for the meat industry and health authorities. Increased size of chickens, along with high speed slaughterhouse output requires more efficient cooling than is possible with the currently used technology alone. The ThorIce add-on solution provides increased chilling efficiency that is applicable in most current facilities, without the need to build larger chilling chambers or installing of longer conveyer belts. Therefore, offering great savings for the meat processor, as well as improved food quality and safety.</Technology_Description></item>
<item><Technology_Description>The project intends to explore the feasibility of introducing to the market Sea Litter Critters, a compact, unmanned, renewables-powered and self sufficient marine litter collection and treatment vessel based on a patent pending device treating waste thermally with plasma technology and no harmful emissions. This device is designed to operate near the shores especially nearer tourist facilities substituting the mechanical collection of litter currently adopted. By picking up litter (plastic debris mostly) near the point of entry, Sea Litter Critters contribute to minimising the pollution risks linked to plastic in the sea, where plastic items become brittle and break down into small particles, but basically never dissolve. Such particles can be eaten by zooplankton thus enter the foodchain. Therefore picking up plastic debris while still intact and as soon as possible after their disposal supports and complement in the short term all the high level policy actions for litter prevention (minimisation of waste, use of biodegradable plastic, awareness raising, beach clean up days etc.). This study aims to check the attractiveness of the innovation to the market involving potential customers (coast towns, associations of tourist and fishing ports and marinas, representatives from the cruise and hotels industry, marine natural reserves authorities). The first markets identified are on the Mediterranean Sea, which is at the center of a very highly populated area of the World with many Countries relying mostly on tourism. Studies confirm that the Med has mostly marine litter derived from this economic activity and up to 80% of it originating from land. Italy, with its over 7600km long coastline and a strong dependency upon tourism, will be the first market, followed suit by France and Croatia and then Spain and Greece. After a 3 year phase to cover development, industrialisation and commercialisation, production is expected to start in 2019, with employment of 17 new staff.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>Slag is a by-product of metal smelting, and ~3.5 million tpa are produced globally in refining Non Ferrous Metals (NFM) and making alloys. Slag contains impurities and forms a protective crust of non-metallic &amp; metallic oxides, and contains significant ‘free’ &amp; alloyed metal (from 10 to 70% by weight). While slag can be used as aggregate, there are increasing concerns over ‘leaching’ of heavy metals into water courses from using these materials in civil engineering. While some metal can be recovered by re-melting slag (at very high temp), this is extremely expensive with very high energy burden which often makes recovery un-economic, but necessary. Landfill of slag is increasingly not an option. Our idea is to use a relatively new technology called ‘implosion’ to selectively break down and separate non-metallic components of slag from metallic particles. This will be combined with ultrasonic vibration sieving for accelerated recovery of metal from the finest fraction. This novel technology was originally developed to recycle waste glass by reducing it to fine ‘sand’, with uniform size and no ‘sharps’ compared to normal crushing techniques.

At present different techniques are needed to inspect the ballast, track substructure and tunnels. TRACKSCAN would undertake these activities and more through non-invasive inspection. Within Europe ballast inspection requires digging a trench or driving plastic lined steel tubes into ballast with a pneumatic hammer. This is obviously impractical, time consuming, labour intensive and can miss ballast fouling. TRACKSCAN inspects all ballast so that maintenance can be targeted and effective. The feasibility study proposed intends to verify the technological and practical aspects of the system and ensure the business concept is sound. The system is described in terms of what can be achieved the science behind it is retained as confidential, as permitted by the call. The penetrating radar system has a rotating antenna which allows 360 degrees inspection and in any plane, this means that unlike other ballast inspection systems in the US, the TRACKSCAN system can extend beyond the vehicle width.

With sharpening regulations, environmental concerns, and the need for sustainable practices to ensure continued agriculture and food supply, the market is witnessing increased demand for safe and sustainable biocidal agents, while maintaining demanding requirements in cost, scalability, and availability. HPGen is a disruptive technology product, enabling for the first time on-demand, cost-effective production of hydrogen peroxide - an eco-friendly biocide and oxygenator, directly at the point of use, using only water, air and electricity as feedstock ! HPGen is set to displace presently used, increasingly regulated toxic chemical products in agriculture, and in turn in livestock sectors. By doing so, HPNow will address EU objectives in improved food and water safety, increased crop yields, and reduction of environmental impact, transport and handling of toxic agri-chemical agents. Implementing HPGen at agriculture and livestock farms in the EU and globally will substantially reduce direct and indirect biocide costs, and create a &gt; EUR 2 billion market opportunity across the value chain. HPGen is being developed, and will be brought to market, by HPNow ApS, a Danish SME. The company has already attracted the attention and collaboration of multinational industry players, including an EU-based global leader in hydrogen peroxide production, three of the world’s leading micro irrigation companies, and one of the EU's largest specialty meat producers. These global firms will be contributing resources and knowhow to the project at their own cost, with their interest in later serving as HPGen channel partners - a key to our company's scalable go-to-market strategy. In Phase I commercial, technical, and production activities related to HPGen market introduction will be analyzed, and a comprehensive business plan will result.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>Water is used in almost all ceramic processes. The production cycle of porcelain stoneware in particular, as all wet production cycles, uses large quantities of water and generates considerable quantities of sludge. Currently, a line that processes 1.000.000 sq/m of tiles per year requires approximately 113.000.000 litres of water and generates sludge that contains more than 600 tons of abraded dust. It is estimated that the European ceramics industry, to produce approximately 1.300 million sqm of tiles, consumes more than 30.000 million cube meters of water, compared to the 8 million used by a city of approximately 300,000 inhabitants. In addition, the market demand in ceramic sector requires more and more products to have high intrinsic technical characteristics (reduced absorption, high surface hardness, abrasion resistance) that are typical of porcelain stoneware. These features are obtained through mechanical finishing treatment (polishing and lapping) of fired tiles. Unfortunately, there is a negative side to machining surfaces after firing: it implies the use of a considerable amount of water and generates and equally large amount of sludge. This generates waste, which in addition to material removed, also contains process water.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>Mineral and metal resources are the foundation for our lives and lifestyles, and mining is still the primary method of their extraction. The sustainability in mining industry can be increased only through more intelligent, efficient and optimized processes that use reduced amount of energy, water and chemicals, and cause reduced amount of waste during different mining stages. Material flows in mining sector are huge. Globally, it is produced 5 billion tons of ore and 10 billion tons of side rock every year. About 70-80 % of mine energy consumption is used for transport, crushing and grinding – 2/3 of that in vain for side rock transportation, crushing and grinding. Even a small improvement in mining selectivity can achieve significant reduction to energy and water use and prevent waste formation.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>Aquaculture has done reasonably well to supplement the expanding consumption of fish and seafood in the EU but has still been unable to have the desired impact because of the high set up, operating and maintenance costs; lack of space along the coastal shores; pollution and threats of diseases and eutrophication. Hence, we developed SubCage – a working proof of concept prototype to TRL 6 which is based on a patented Tension Leg Cage (TLC) technology capable of submerging fish cages to depths of up to 55 m at a controlled velocity based on the principle of wave ispersion. This prototype is a 12 m diameter fully submersible fish cage, which has been tested for 2 years in Crete using red porgy. This was successfully demonstrated as there were no issues during the operation and thus confirmed that SubCage satisfies all customer needs, such as: cost benefit solution for fish farming in unsheltered area; increase of fish quality; improvement of fish health and mortality rate. Despite the risk surrounding aquaculture in the unsheltered regions due to its environment; we proved that, by using SubCage, expanding production capabilities in such areas is feasible, commercially beneficial to farmers and can increase the value of the fish species. With the help of the SME instrument in scaling up our prototype to a 30-55 m diameter commercially acceptable fish cage, we would expect to contribute to an increase in fish price of up to 20% and additional increase in yield of up to 2% in comparison with surface cages. In comparison with competitor technologies, our prices will be several times lower by 30-40% as well as an estimated ROI being achievable in approximately 3 years. Within 5 years, we can humbly anticipate to enhance the production capacity of the EU by 2%. This translates to Refa Med Srl. deploying 402 SubCage units in the EU within 5 years, generating a revenue stream of over €80 million and helping create between 300 and 400 product-related full-time jobs.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>The seed market will grow at a CAGR of 10.57% during the period 2014-2019 and is expected to increase to $24 billion from its current $14.52 billion value. Europe, with 3 of its countries (France, Germany and The Netherlands) as three of the top four seed exporters in the world includes nearly 7,200 seed companies and more than 50,000 employees. Production of high quality seeds can increase crop yield by 15-20%. Seed moisture content needs to be controlled to ensure high germination rates, thus high quality seeds. An optimum drying process with control of air’s relative humidity and temperature is needed to ensure harvested seed is at safe moisture content before storage or other purposes. Existing drying and cooling methods for seeds lack of control of these parameters, are not energy efficient and require high investment from farmers. Moreover, seed drying is one of the most energy consuming processes on farms, consuming as much energy as all field works together. With an efficient seed drying process, savings for farmers could be more than 50%. DryCoolerSeeds is able to dry and cool the seeds in a continuous monitored process with adaptation to climate variations, saving energy (99% of energy saved), time (2.5 less time needed than traditional dryers), ensuring the correct moisture content and temperature of seeds, resulting therefore in high quality seeds. Marcold’s technology is a step further in automation, simplification and costs savings (&gt;60% compared to mix flow drying) being able to incorporate two different functions (drying and cooling) in a single machine surpassing the competition in the current market. The aim of the project is to build and demonstrate in real end user’s facilities our DryCoolerSeeds prototype adjusting the working parameters for effective conservation of seeds while ensuring a successful commercialization of the technology in Europe and Latin America that will drive Marcold into an exponential growth.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>Compsule is a compostable capsule designed for instant espresso coffee machines such as ones produced by Lavazza and Nespresso, that operates at a high temperature and pressure. Compsule aims to contribute to reduce the amount of recyclable material being sent to landfills as a result of the increased use of capsuled coffee. In Italy alone over 1 billion plastic coffee capsules are consumed annually. Albeit being made of 100% recyclable materials, coffee capsules are barely recycled due to the time and effort required in cleaning and sorting the capsule’s components after use. Point Plastics have developed an innovative chemical additive that when mixed with bioplastics increases their thermal stability, making them compatible for extreme operational applications such as espresso coffee extraction. This process technology has a great impact on biobased polymer producers enabling a wider market share in fields impossible to target today. Compsules will be able to be disposed of with other food and green waste that is commonly collected by municipalities within the European Union, thus reducing the amount of waste being sent to landfills by hundreds of thousands of tonnes per year. For coffee producers the capsules will reduce their carbon footprint and respond to the demand of an increasingly environmentally conscious consumer base. For the capsule printing manufacturers, the Compsule does not impose any new machinery on their current production line as the Compsules can be manufactured similarly to the polymers currently used. For capsuled coffee drinkers the Compsules are both airtight and designed to fit user’s current machines, allowing them to be easily adopted.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>MET s.r.l. is an Italian SME focused on translating the sanitizing action of ozone into innovative industrial applications for transportation, agro-food and, recently, greenhouse crops. Greenhouse farms are very efficient food producers facing two major challenges: a) up to 15% crop losses due to several thousand pests caused by fungi, bacteria and viruses and b) the urgent need to comply with environmental European regulations (Integrated Pest Management) and with the growing demands of European consumers for healthier and environmentally sustainable food (i.e., organic agriculture). Existing solutions are insufficient to cover greenhouse farmer needs: Chemical phytosanitary products are inefficient (pests develop resistance), environmentally undesirable and unsafe for greenhouse workers and consumers (synthetic chemicals may leave toxic rests in food). Biopesticides, yet environmentally friendly, are excessively selective (each substance targets only one or few specific pests) thus ineffective for the broad pest spectrum faced by each greenhouse farmer. In this context, MET has developed O3MET: an innovative technology for spraying aqueous ozone (O3) for pest control and sanitation of greenhouse crops, taking advantage of the powerful oxidation-based (hence non-selective) anti-pathogen action of ozone. O3MET offers greenhouse farmers a solution that is: clean (self-disintegrated into oxygen in a few minutes); cost-effective (€6000/ha/year savings in chemicals and labour); environmentally sustainable (decreasing the need for polluting chemical pesticides); and safe for workers (remote ozone application by the operator from outside the greenhouse, and minimized post-application safety interval) and food consumers (ozone is residue-free and also extends vegetable shelf life). Once brought to industrial scale, O3MET would reach 10,000 ha of greenhouses (i.e., 2,000 farmers) in the EU/Mediterranean market, with a €60 million turnover accumulated in 5 years.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>Mastitis is an infection of the udder in dairy cattle. It is a major problem in the dairy industry, costing European farmers tens of millions of Euros annually. Milk somatic cell count (SCC) is used as a main indicator of mastitis, as the number of somatic cells in milk increases in response to infection in the udder. Krysium Technologies has developed and patented LacDetect® – an innovative, portable, economic test system allowing reliable and truly rapid detection of sub-clinical mastitis on-farm based on enumeration of SCCs via ATP-luminescence technology. This allows farm workers and veterinarians to make quick decisions on herd management and avoid significant costs associated with clinical mastitis. Furthermore, as SCC is also used as a measurement of milk quality, dairy producers base their milk pricing policy significantly on SCC values in raw milk. LacDetect® will enable recording of SCCs on-site for payment purposes. LacDetect® is at Technology Readiness Level 6. Initial testing has repeatedly shown results from our prototype test system compare very favourably with those from a major milk laboratory. In this Phase I project we intend to review the specification of LacDetect®, to ensure that production costs are reduced and that the end-product specification meets user requirements. We will re-contact and add commercial partners for field testing and commercializing plus explore other routes to market. On completion of Phase I we intend to progress to a Phase II project during which we will carry out final product development, scale-up manufacture, validation and final customer trials prior to commercial launch of LacDetect® initially in key EU markets. Completion of the overall project will deliver a one-minute, on-farm raw milk test system enabling EU farmers to detect problems in dairy cows early, enabling better antibiotic treatment decisions, improved production, reduction in costs, higher margins, better animal welfare and less environmental impact.</Technology_Description></item>
<item><Technology_Description>The world production of table olives has been increasing in the last few years. According to the International Olive Council (IOC), the 2013/2014 season could reach a production of 2.5 million tons of olives, 4% more than the previous season (2012/2013). Although the table olive production process has become a very high-tech industry in some aspects, one of the most important steps in the process, the debittering stage, is still very much based on the tradition, experience and subjectivity of the technicians who are in charge of it. This is mainly because, to date, there is no available system or tool aimed at improving this process. Thus, there is a clear need in the European table olive industry for technological innovations that can improve the table olive manufacturing processes, particularly in the debittering stage. TELEOLIVA, a new debittering-process monitoring system created by Global Olive, proposes a profound, ground-breaking invention that will lead the transformation of the European traditional table olive sector into an innovative, sustainable and optimized one. The system, which is a set of self-developed ICT tools capable of on-line and real time monitoring of the debittering process, aims to improve product quality by objectively determining the optimal duration of the debittering process stage while reducing production costs and reducing waste generation and negative environmental impacts by avoiding unnecessary input utilization. The main objective of this project is to determine the technical feasibility of the TELEOLIVA system at an industrial scale. At the same time, an economic and market feasibility assessment of the new tool will be conducted in order to prepare a business plan. TELEOLIVA´s target market includes all table olive manufacturers, beginning with those in Europe and eventually expanding worldwide. Currently, no high-tech solutions such as the TELEOLIVA system are offered by any competing company.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>In the project ACT4INFRA a novel technology for an automated and  remote controlled valves in public networks, such as water, gas or district heating, shall be commercialized on mass market scale. The technology addresses the public urban piping systems, e.g. for water, gas or district heating, which are today almost fully mechanical, manually controlled and extremely vulnerable with respect to criminal interventions or terroristic attacks. The ACT4INFRA technology has been developed within the past years by the German SME company 3S-Antriebe GmbH. Core of the innovation is a patented rotationally locked support plate (‘System Berliner Kappe’), which enables retrofitting of automated actuators in already existing valves without flanging and without a manhole. Additionally, the actuators have been optimized for low energy consumption and can operate fully decentralized powered by batteries. The entire system is controlled by safety-approved wireless communication systems, fulfilling the strong requirements of the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI). No construction work for cabling and no switching cabinet is required. The ACT4INFRA system is a key enabling technology for low cost  retrofitting in order to protect vital urban infrastructure against unauthorized access. This allows to implement smart and secure networks of piping systems. Within ACT4INFRA, 3S strives for systematic market development, distribution strategy and effective international commercialization of this technology on abroad, international mass markets. Thus, Phase 1 starts with a feasibility study , where market structure, customer needs, boundary conditions in different countries and geographical areas, cost structures, economy of scale and production strategies are analyzed. An updated business plan with these results will be prepared.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>Safe drinking water is essentially a global concern, thus resulting in a considerably large market for water quality monitoring. Besides, potential terrorists might threaten water infrastructure in European cities, since poisoning the tap water is a low-cost attack that easily generates social panic and economic loss to the society. Due to lack of the ideal early warning tools on water safety, large amount of routine sampling and testing have to be done frequently to fight against possible CBRN threats on urban water supply. This project addresses feasibility study for the technical and economic viability of Biological Water Alarm System (BiWAS): An innovative low-cost early warning device for monitoring of drinking water safety over a broad spectrum of harmful substances, including (1) acute toxicant chemicals, (2) chronic carcinogenic chemicals, and (3) waterborne pathogens. The innovative content of BiWAS lies in the miniaturisation and integration with multidisciplinary knowledge, which makes BiWAS a continuous, automatic and portable device working for long period with only annually or biannually maintenance. The potential customers include public water suppliers, household users, hospitals, hotels, culinary and food industries, etc. An early warning system against CBRN threats in drinking water can be realized without more investment. A feasibility assessment on BiWAS product under Phase 1 includes market investigation, business plan development, risk assessment, intellectual property management and innovation strategy development. In the potential Phase 2, a commercializable prototype of BiWAS will be expected, which can be probably the first low-cost and broad-spectrum early warning device for water safety. With the outcome of Phase 1, it will guide the European companies towards the leading role of the global water quality monitoring techniques, and open a big door to the large market of global water quality monitoring, from Europe to the world.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>The world is sitting on a ‘CRT mountain’; For TVs and monitors, Cathode Ray Tubes have been the main screen technology, up until the revolutionary change to LCD and plasma screens that has recently taken place. Consequently, the current CRT population (1.9 billion screens; 500 million of them in Europe) is becoming obsolete and will require processing (not landfill) according to WEEE regulations, since the high proportion of lead in the glass means that landfills have an unacceptable risk of lead leaching into groundwater. The very low manufacturing rates for new CRT worldwide now mean that recycling the glass back into CRTs is no longer an option, and the only alternatives to avoid landfill have been to use the glass as a smelting flux (85% of it remains as a toxic slag), or using foundry temperatures (1000°C) melt extraction for the lead, which is extremely energy and CO2 costly, and at best produces an 80% co-stream of low value glass.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>The main aim of this proposal is to generate an updated revision of GTZ’s initial Business Plan (BP I), to overcome the main challenges detected for the successful MicroLAB market launch. The following aspects will be pursued: 1) specific marketing tools and sales strategy (Europe, North and South America, Asia) devoted to feedstock producers and micro &amp; small food companies (≤50 employees), to speed up, the market share achievement (2,6%); 2) product innovation policy to assure the company growth in the food safety business; 3) technical feasibility study for a cost-effective production process (&lt;5 €/device) and its lay-out definition; 4) revision of the organization growth plans to assure its sustainability; 5) and an updated review of the economical and financial plans. The food sector is the second largest manufacturing industry micro, small and medium sized companies suppose the 99. The business size profile has a relevant impact on the deployment of the safety assurance measures and the feedstock sustainable production (minimization of waste and GHGE). Due to the micro and most of the small companies’ size (&lt; 20 employees), the accomplishment of the mandatory plans for quality and food safety assurance, makes of it a big hurdle difficult to overcome. Alternative rapid kits have been developed to facilitate food pathogen assessment, but none of them, covers the whole microbial detection routine in an easy and affordable way. So, micro and small food companies ought to outsource this service (18-20 €/test, 8,500 €/year), with the added drawback of relying a very sensitive issue in third parties. The small dairy, meat and poultry farms, can’t cover these controls, being assumed by the secondary transformers, with the additional costs of logistics, cross-contamination and factory’s stops, if feedstock refuse. The solution has been carefully considered, and it’s a challenge that GTZ is eager to assume, by the manufacture and the market launch of MicroLAB.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>Natural Machines is a SME that has created the first 3D food printer that works with sweet and savory ingredients. We are focused on helping people get back to home cooking, back to healthy food, by bringing the food processing plant to the home kitchens, giving an eco-efficient alternative to traditional food processing, reducing food waste to zero and with significant savings in energy and packaging needed with no need to spend time cooking or knowing how to do it. Following the lean startup model, we introduced a model for B2B customers that allow them to create dishes, decorations, customizations, suitable for hospitals, restaurants, bakeries, etc. In order to get our product to the home kitchens, users have requested two main features that go far beyond 3D printing technology. The two systems are a new cooking technology that uses just a fraction of the energy used by traditional ovens and microwave ovens and a prefilled capsule system. Both systems working together will convert our new device in an optimised sustainable mini food processing plant at home. The cooking system provides a very granular control of the temperature of the food being cooked, allowing to preserve the nutritional properties of the ingredients and cook according to the user tastes. This system can work also as a standalone device, which opens also new OEM and licensing opportunities for our company. It provides also a safer operation, as no element in the device will be heated to a point of causing harm, as compared to an oven. From a business perspective, reaching the mass market (home kitchens) will allow us to more tan double current revenue forecasts according to initial interest in USA, Europe and Asia, and to introduce new business models, like capsule licensing that will generate new revenue sources. We expect the feasibility study to provide us with a better market insight and a complete business plan for bringing our device to the market.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>Today, because of the large dimensions and costs of finishing machines, most printing houses cannot be equipped with a full production line and, after digital printing, they must send fabrics to third companies for finishing and for specific functionalizations. For European SMEs, this leads a general increase of production time and costs and a further threat to competitiveness against the larger and mass-production structured Far East companies. All over Europe, several digital printing SMEs located out of a textile district, are currently suffering the absence of a close, complete supply chain, and they seriously risk of closing their activities because of this scarce completeness. ECOFLEX is going to be proposed to the market of digitally printed fabrics, which is leaded by Europe with 45% total share and is expected to grow in the next years according to recent Industry surveys. Thanks to ECOFLEX, all the operations needed for the textiles finishing and functionalisation will be performed in a single, all-in-one and customized machine, available at low price and compact dimensions. The main benefits for the ECOFLEX users will be: Reduction of the initial investment of about 70%, Reduction of waste and production costs of about 30%, Reduction in the consumption of water and energy of about 30% and 50% respectively, time to market reduction, floor optimization, full control over the quality and repeatability of the final product, resources valorisation.</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>Sea lice are the most damaging parasite to the salmonid farming industry in Europe, inflicting an annual loss of €300 million. Lice originating from farms also represent a grave danger to wild populations. Fish farmers use many different methods in the effort to control sea lice infestations. However, none have proved 100% effective and sustainable over time due to environmental impacts, negative consumer perception, violation of fish welfare, and not the least of which is cost. Both governmental bodies and the aquaculture sector are now asking for a sustainable solution to the huge problems resulting from sea lice infestation of both farmed and wild salmonid stocks. Optical delousing (Stingray) is a new proactive, gentle and sustainable method for controlling the amount of sea lice in net pens. Using camera vision, software and laser allow for fully automatic louse removal without posing any danger to farmed fish, other species, or surrounding environment. The project aims to develop a dedicated advanced machine vision unit, the EctoVision, to increase the field of view, depth perception and image processing speed.  The unit will be made available as an upgrade that can be easily integrated with the existing Stingray platform. The aim is to create an efficient range to detect lice and treat fish that passes within 0.4-1.5 m in the proximity of the Stingray to improve the lice removal performance by a twofold. Activities in the feasibility assessment includes  investigation of possible solutions for the machine vision system, mapping best available state of the art and evaluate performance balanced against cost, in addition to search for additional partners. Case studies will be performed to provide a detailed assessment of the expected economic impact using the Stingray with the EctoVision upgrade compared with competing methods. The results will be outlined in a business plan with proper risk assessment, including a preliminary product design specification.</Technology_Description></item>
<item><Technology_Description>To meet the challenges of growing world food consumption, environmental preservation and sustainable food production, spirulina has been identified as an extremely valuable solution by many international bodies. However, this microalgae is still a largely underutilised food resource. The reasons are organoleptic (foul taste and smell) and, most importantly, cultural (algae are not part of the Western culinary art).</Technology_Description></item>

<item><Technology_Description>Blue4Green will develop a portable sample handling/sensing system for DNA and/or RNA fragments. The input to such a system is a raw sample of milk, containing the bacteria to be analysed that causes mastitis. Most of the time treatment starts without knowing the responsible pathogen. Often, the wrong (or not most optimal) antibiotic is used as treatment. When therapy fails, new mastitis incidences and prevalence’s are rising. To test, at this moment farmers collect their samples in testing tubes. These tubes should be transported and send to a laboratory. Within the laboratory, the fluid is tested and the farmer receives the results within three (or more) days. The new technology, concerns a more rapid detection method. Within the technique of B4G, it is possible to know which pathogen is responsible for the inflammation to treat mastitis infection within three minutes instead of three days (or more) since the farmer can test it by himself. With a rapid mastitis pathogen test:</Technology_Description></item>
<item><Technology_Description>Fresh’ fruits for the consumer market can only be sold as such if they are shown to be a certain standard of ‘ripeness’, as judged by the sugar content and firmness. There is great commercial pressure on producers to provide produce which is of the appropriate standard. Apples which do not meet this standard can be sold to the wholesale market or juiced with losses to market value of 50% and 95% respectively, but apples &amp; citrus fruits which are destructively tested are sold as animal feed, composted or sent to landfill. </Technology_Description></item>
<item><Technology_Description>In order to feed the larger, more urban and richer population, food production must increase by 70%, and annual cereal production will need to rise to about 3 billion tonnes from 2.1 billion today. However, there are limited opportunities to expand the area of agricultural land without huge detrimental impact on the natural environment. As a consequence, sustainable increase of food supply must be based on productivity improvements. Plant breeding has significantly contributed to and will continue to be a major contributor to increased food security.</Technology_Description></item>
<item><Technology_Description>By realising a very high process intensification of the electrochemical metal deposition process, the InlinePlat project aims to develop and bring to market modular, fully automated production units for electroplating of mechanical parts and components which can be directly integrated into the manufacturing lines of mechanical engineering companies, automotive suppliers, components and systems manufacturers etc. as self-standing functional metal coating systems. Compared to the very high degree of automation and production integration of the machining, assembling and other mechanical manufacturing processes, the electroplating processes still have a very high potential of optimization in terms of process efficiency, reduction of logistics, increase of automation and production integration. </Technology_Description></item>
