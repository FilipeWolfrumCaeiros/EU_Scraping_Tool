The exposome concept refers to the totality of environmental exposures from conception onwards, and is a novel approach to studying the role of the environment in human disease. This project will move the field forward by utilising data on individual external exposome (including sensors, smartphones, geo-referencing, satellites), and omic profiles in an agnostic search for new and integrated biomarkers. These tools will be applied in both experimental short-term studies and long-term longitudinal studies in humans. The ultimate goal is to use the new tools in risk assessment and in the estimation of the burden of environmental disease.

Such STM waste water is extensively contaminated with oils and greases, organic loading, a salt fraction and especially with heavy metals (e.g. nickel, copper, zinc and others). Hence STM enterprises have high interest on efficient, cost-effective and sustainable treatment of their effluents. ECOWAMA’s approach combines wastewater treatment with recovery of ultrapure water, highly valuable metals and energy. Therefore an environmental friendly, effective and innovative system will be developed including Electrocoagulation, Electrooxidation and Electrowinning technologies. Additionally hydrogen produced during Electrocoagulation/Electrooxidation processes will be used to deal as feed for fuel cells to generate electricity which reduces the energy demand of the whole process. Pre- and post-treatment will be carried out to remove oils/greases and conductivity. The heavy metals will be separated from the waste water stream through an electro-precipitation process. After metal dissolution from precipitation sludge a novel electrowinning process using novel electrodes, optimised geometry and process management will reduce the dissolved metal ions to a solid aggregate state with high purity.

OpenNESS will therefore develop innovative and practical ways of applying them in land, water and urban management: it will identify how, where and when the concepts can most effectively be applied to solve problems. To do this, it will work with public and private decision makers and stakeholders to better understand the range of policy and management problems faced in different case study contexts (ranging across locales, sectors, scales and time). OpenNESS will consolidate, refine and develop a range of spatially-explicit methods to identify, quantify and value ecosystem services, and will develop hybrid assessment methods. It will also explore the effectiveness of financial and governance mechanisms, such as payments for ecosystem services, habitat banking, biodiversity offsetting and land and ecosystem accounting. These types of interventions have potential for sustaining ESS and NC, and for the design of new economic and social investment opportunities. Finally, OpenNESS will assess how current regulatory frameworks and other institutional factors at EU and national levels enable or constrain consideration of ESS and NC, and identify the implications for issues related to well-being, governance and competitiveness. OpenNESS will analyse the knowledge that is needed to define ESS and NC in the legal, administrative and political contexts that are relevant to the EU.

Re-framing environmental resource use has led to the emergence of the concepts of ecosystem services (ES) and natural capital (NC). This discourse indicates not only a change in our understanding of planetary functions at the ecosystem scale, but also a fundamental shift in how we perceive the relationship between people and the ecosystems on which they depend. OPERAs (OPERATIONAL POTENTIAL OF ECOSYSTEMS RESEARCH APPLICATIONS) aims to improve understanding of how ES/NC contribute to human well-being in different social-ecological systems in inland and coastal zones, in rural and urban areas, related to different ecosystems including forests and fresh water resources. The OPERAs research will establish whether, how and under what conditions the ES/NC concepts can move beyond the academic domain towards practical implementation in support of sustainable ecosystem management. OPERAs will use a meta-analysis (systematic review) of existing ES/NC practice to identify knowledge gaps and requirements for new policy options and instruments.

Its importance as plant nutrient is emphasized by the huge amount of 975 000 tons of phosphorus annually imported into Europe to sustain good harvests. While phosphorus is a limited fossil element, its extensive recovery from “secondary deposits” is of paramount importance and follows the principles of the European Roadmap for Resource Recovery. Municipal wastewater represents a relevant phosphorus reserve and has the potential to cover about 20% of the demand. Technology concepts have been developed in recent European projects to tap into this local resource. While the traditional application of sewage sludge in agriculture is increasingly refused by stakeholders, this path has to be further secured to protect the environment and human health. In addition, technological alternatives to recycle phosphorus are available and need yet to be deployed on to the market. The P-REX project builds on the outputs of previous European research projects and will perform the first holistic full-scale evaluation of technical phosphorus recovery techniques using municipal sludge or ashes in comparison with phosphorus recycling by land application of sewage sludge. The technical, operational and economic data as well as a comprehensive ecotoxicological and plant-availability assessments will provide the basis of comprehensive life cycle and life cost assessments of phosphorus recovery processes. Complementing a market analysis, a guidance document for policy makers and end users will show the best phosphorus recovery options depending on regional conditions and illustrated by selected case studies. The results of the project will be extensively disseminated in international workshops and regional events in order to facilitate local implementations.

The need to improve air quality in European Countries has been identified as a major requirement to be achieved within the next decade in the effort to control climate change, a key Europe 2020 strategy, and to improve human health. Despite vigorous efforts to reduce levels of hazardous substances in the air, targets remain a challenge. One of the most valid sustainable technologies explored so far is photocatalytic concrete. This technology is proven to reduce the amount of hazardous air pollutants up to 80 % . It also imparts self-cleaning properties to built structures which has a secondary effect of reducing harsh cleaning chemicals entering the water systems. However, the titanium oxide based photocatalytic building materials are activated by ultraviolet light so, to date, such environmental benefits are limited to countries with a high incidence of sunlight. The concept of this project is to extend the use of photocatalytic concretes to the whole of Europe by developing materials that can also be activated by visible light .  The aim is to remove climate and seasonal considerations from the use of the materials and, through higher conversion efficiencies of the catalytic components, to reduce production costs facilitating further take up of the technology within existing markets. The results of the project are initially focused on use within the transport infrastructure where the greatest impact is expected. The consortium is well conceived to achieve the results, comprising research centres leading research in these materials and industry partners including SMEs able to develop, demonstrate and market the new materials in the sector.",,"2015-08-31, closed project |","<meta name=""WT.cg_s"" content=""FP7-ENVIRONMENT"">",FP7-ENV-2011-ECO-INNOVATION-TwoStage,CP - Collaborative project (generic),Denmark,"Research Organisations,Dorthe Mathiesen,Tel.: +4572202205,Private for-profit entities (excluding Higher or Secondary Education Establishments),Johny Poulsen,Tel.: +45 8682 2900,Private for-profit entities (excluding Higher or Secondary Education Establishments),Samir Gonzalez-Quintero,Tel.: +34 962503111,Fax: +34 962503465,Private for-profit entities (excluding Higher or Secondary Education Establishments),Jan Lang,Tel.: +46 44 20 25 27,Fax: +46 44 20 26 20,Private for-profit entities (excluding Higher or Secondary Education Establishments),Francesca Stinelli,Tel.: +39 06 40040358,Fax: +39 06 40040364,Private for-profit entities (excluding Higher or Secondary Education Establishments),Magnus Ohlsson,Tel.: +46 8 58796920,Fax: +46 0 1927 04 19,Private for-profit entities (excluding Higher or Secondary Education Establishments),Russell Evans,Tel.: +44 1642 376215,Higher or Secondary Education Establishments,Helena Rogers,Tel.: +44 1224 273682,Fax: +44 1224 272319,Research Organisations,Cadenas Alfonso,Tel.: +34 610 501 373,Fax: +34 96 131 8033,Public bodies (excluding Research Organisations and Secondary or Higher Education Establishments),Jane Snog,Tel.: +4533663523,Public bodies (excluding Research Organisations and Secondary or Higher Education Establishments),Eva Maria Botella,Tel.: +34 96 36 26 011,Fax: +34 96 36 26 650,Research Organisations,Finn Thøgersen,Tel.: +45 7244 7119,Private for-profit entities (excluding Higher or Secondary Education Establishments),Ernesto Molinos Redo,Tel.: +34 600 320 539,Other,Amparo Salome Reillo Redon,Tel.: +34 96 39 10 477",,"EUR 3 574 545,60",283062,ENV.2011.3.1.9-1 - Eco-innovation!

Conventional, centralized approaches have failed in many areas and will hardly be able to solve potential problems in rural, hilly and rapidly developing urban areas in India. Instead, innovative, decentralised systems aiming at various benefits are needed. A main benefit in the context of SARASWATI is the reuse of treated wastewater for different purposes. Other benefits include reuse of energy and nutrients, which are also important. Despite the overall poor condition of wastewater treatment across South Asia, India has already considerable experience with such decentralised approaches. Over the last decade, hundreds of decentralised wastewater treatment plants of different technology types have been installed all over India. However, not all are functioning well and several also failed, due to various reasons. Also, there is no consolidated evaluation and review of all those existing plants available. As a result there is only very limited knowledge on the performance of those existing technologies available and a review and evaluation of those plants is very timely in order to derive sound conclusions and recommendations for future wastewater management strategies in India. SARASWATI will perform such a comprehensive and independent evaluation and hence provide key suggestions for the improvement of existing technologies.  In addition, SARASWATI aims at deploying selected proven EU technologies with a potential for solving grave water challenges in India (water pollution due to discharge of untreated wastewater and storm-water, water scarcity and groundwater depletion, unhygienic sludge handling practices due to lack of suitable technologies).

Harmful algal blooms and habitat destruction are examples, which pose serious human-health threats and severely affect numerous industries, causing annual economic losses in the tens of millions of euros, in the form of reduced sales, diminished tourist activity and unemployment. A widely adopted, scientific way to assess the environmental status of water bodies is by measuring their optical properties (as indicators of, e.g., sewage impact, dissolved organic matter, sediment load or gross biological activity). The Citclops project aims to develop systems to retrieve and use data on seawater colour, transparency and fluorescence, using low-cost sensors combined with contextual information (e.g., georeferencing) and a community-based Internet platform, taking into account existing experiences (e.g., Secchi Dip-In, Coastwatch Europe and Oil Reporter). Simple and fast methods to establish the optical properties of seawater will be developed and used: e.g., the colour through Forel-Ule observations, and transparency through a variant of the Secchi disc. People will be able to acquire data taking photographs of the sea surface on ferries or other vessels, at the open sea or from the beach. Wearable digital cameras for aquatic activities with extended sensing systems are also proposed as alternative resources for crowdsourcing data. Data are automatically uploaded through a specific service or application (such as Google+ Instant Upload), archived remotely and processed, and resulting information is accessed through a webpage or a mobile application by end users.

In order to reach the maximal impact the two projects have formed one common work plan for both projects, targeting the same objectives, will present their results at the same web-site and formed a joint management team. Providing adequate water supply and sanitation, particularly in urban areas, is a challenging task for governments throughout the world. This task is made even more difficult due to predicted dramatic global changes. In order to cope with water shortages in urban areas, there is a need for a paradigm shift from conventional end-of-pipe water management to an integrated approach. This integrated approach should include several actions such as: (i) interventions over the entire urban water cycle; (ii) optimisation of water use by reusing wastewater and preventing pollution of freshwater source; (iii) prioritisation of small-scale natural and technical systems, which are flexible, cost-effective and require low operation and maintenance. Natural water systems, such as manmade wetlands and sub-soil filtration and storage via soil aquifer treatment and bank filtration, are such systems. NaWaTech stands for natural water systems and treatment technologies to cope with water shortages in urbanised areas in India. The concept is based on optimised use of different urban water flows by treating each of these flows via a modular natural system taking into account the different nature and degree of pollution of the different water sources.

These forecasts hold the potential for being of great value for a wide range of decision-makers who are affected by the vagaries of the climate and who would benefit from understanding and better managing climate-related risks.  However, such climate information is currently under-used, mis-used, or not used at all.  Therefore there exists the opportunity to develop new technologies to properly exploit emerging capability from the climate community, and more importantly, to engage with the users of such technologies to develop useful and useable tools. The EUPORIAS project will develop and deliver reliable predictions of the impacts of future climatic conditions on a number of key sectors (to include water, energy, health, transport, agriculture and tourism), on timescales from seasons to years ahead. The project will do this through a strong engagement with the forecast providers and the users/decision-makers, who are both represented within the project. EUPORIAS  will develop climate services and tools targeted to the needs of the users, and will share knowledge to promote the technologies created within the project. EUPORIAS will also improve the users’ understanding of their vulnerability to varying climatic conditions as well as better prepare them to utilise climate forecasts, thereby reducing risks and costs associated with responding to varying climatic conditions. As a result businesses, governments, NGOs, and society in general will be able to better manage risks and opportunities associated with varying climatic conditions, thus becoming more resilient to the variability of the climate. The project will provide the basis for developing  a strong climate service market within Europe, offering the opportunity for businesses to capitalise on improved management of weather and climate risks.",,"2017-01-31, closed project","<meta name=""WT.cg_s"" content=""FP7-ENVIRONMENT"">",FP7-ENV-2012-two-stage,CP - Collaborative project (generic),United Kingdom,"Public bodies (excluding Research Organisations and Secondary or Higher Education Establishments),Paula Newton,Tel.: +44 1392 884834,Fax: +44 1392 885681,Higher or Secondary Education Establishments,Celia Lee,Tel.: +351 217500357,Fax: +351217500119,Private for-profit entities (excluding Higher or Secondary Education Establishments),Ghislain Dubois,Tel.: +33610162235,Research Organisations,Giovanni Addamo,Tel.: +390630484711,Public bodies (excluding Research Organisations and Secondary or Higher Education Establishments),Christian Jung,Tel.: +41 44 256 92 24,Fax: +41 44 256 92 78,Higher or Secondary Education Establishments,Juan José San Miguel Roncero,Tel.: +34942201071,Fax: +34942201071,Private for-profit entities (excluding Higher or Secondary Education Establishments),Daniel San Martin,Tel.: +34942764410,Fax: +34942764410,Public bodies (excluding Research Organisations and Secondary or Higher Education Establishments),M.

How to respond to these challenges are key research questions. Although they are global problems, their effects are felt locally, especially by the communities that traditionally base their livelihoods in those natural resources. The relevance of these problems at global level has driven different initiatives to increase public awareness and to put in practice measures to improve them. However, many good conservation and management practices are done at local level. Research is needed to better understand local capabilities and to encourage and support potential locally-owned solutions. COMET-LA’s objective is to identify sustainable community-based governance models for the management of natural resources that could be used in different social-ecological systems in a context of climate change and increasing competition for the use of these resources. A civil society-scientific partnership has been created to develop the project. Three Latin American civil society organizations, a global CSO and 7 research institutions (3 Latin American and 4 European) comprise this partnership. COMET-LA will create a space of interaction for CSOs, policy makers and research organizations, sharing local and scientific knowledge and contributing to a better knowledge of problems and potential solutions for current and future sustainable management of natural resources. Three different case studies will be analyzed: water and biodiversity systems in Colombia, forest systems in Mexico and marine and coastal areas in Argentina. Similar methods will be used to characterize the current and future ecosystem states, sustainable governance models and locally-tailored scenarios for future changes and challenges.

Once isolated via environmentally friendly processes, these two renewable compounds will be used as high-performance additives for the development of a new series of bio-composites The incorporation of those natural components will improve current solutions in two construction applications: panels for indoor structures (interior walls, ceiling, flooring…) and profiles (decking, fencing…) by, respectively, increasing the resistance-to-weight ratio and improving the surface hardness and water absorbency. Other commercial bio-plastics as well as the two major fractions of what straw, cellulose and lignin, will be also incorporated into such materials (cellulose after chemical modification and lignin after being polymerised into both thermosetting and thermoplastic resins), and the resulting products will be finally tested for biodegradability. In the same way as wood, which is at the same time biodegradable and exceptional building material, the use of plant-derived products will increase the biodegradability of the biomaterials without compromising their structural quality.

However, there is a significant knowledge deficit which may hinder full implementation of the MSFD and the achievement of GES in EU waters.STAGES (Science and Technology Advancing Governance on Good Environmental Status) project is designed to directly address this knowledge deficit. The project has to overarching goals: i) to synthezise  per major MSFD themes the information from research projects and ii)  to develop a platform to ensure that the knowledge generated through European science and technology can be channeled to a broad range of relevant end users, to inform and facilitate implementation of the MSFD and the achievement of GES. To achieve this, STAGES will target a number of critical gaps in the knowledge transfer process. Firstly, STAGES will identify and synthesize relevant existing EU research results and make them available in a usable format for decision and policy making authorities. Through comprehensive scientific foresight targeted at MSFD knowledge gaps, STAGES will identify needs for futher research. STAGES will also develop innovative solutions to achieve an effective collaboration between the broad range of stakeholders necessary to support MSDF implementation, including policy and governance, science, industry and civil society. Moreover, the role and input of MSFD stakeholders will be central to the activities of the project and to the proposals for a science policy interface which will be delivered by the project. The partnership has been  constructed to include a combination of EU/international organizations which can represent a broad constituency of MSFD stakeholders, and national organizations with responsibility to support research and provide advice on MSFD implementation at MS level.",,"2014-08-31, closed project","<meta name=""WT.cg_s"" content=""FP7-ENVIRONMENT"">",FP7-ENV-2012-one-stage,CSA-SA - Support actions,Spain,"Research Organisations,Belen Pungin,Tel.: +34986247047,Other,Telmo Carvalho,Tel.: +351213924486,Research Organisations,Jean-Francois Cadiou,Tel.: +33494304975,Other,David Weber,Tel.: +33 3 88 76 7150,Fax: +33 3 88 76 7181,Other,Marieke Reuver,Tel.: +353 1 644 9008,Research Organisations,Adi Kellermann,Tel.: +4533386714,Fax: +4533934215,Public bodies (excluding Research Organisations and Secondary or Higher Education Establishments),Romilda Manicolo,Tel.: +39 0332 786612,Research Organisations,øivind Bergh,Tel.: +4748036706",,"EUR 999 692,04",308473,ENV.2012.6.2-5 - Improve scientific knowledge base to support the implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive ('The Ocean for Tomorrow')
