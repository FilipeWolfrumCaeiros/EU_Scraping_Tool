  Technology_Description: 'Water supply involves many actors. While many management
    tools exist, they cannot intercommunicate and no framework is available for integrating
    all of them, preventing integrated water resources management to be fully achieved.
    WatERP will develop a web-based Open Management Platform (OMP), integrating intelligent
    systems through open interfaces, to enable water supply distribution chains to
    be managed in a unified and customized way. The OMP will provide inferred information
    on water supplies, flows, consumption, distribution efficiency, and supply and
    demand within a single framework. It comprises 3 tools: (a) Data Warehouse, using
    semantics and common language, (b) DSS, for coordinating actions, prioritizing
    water uses, improving distribution efficiency, and saving water, energy and costs,
    and (c) Demand Management, supporting socio-economical analyses and policies.
    Open standards will be used to maximize interoperability and data sharing. WatERP
    technologies will be developed under a user-centred participatory design.9 Partners
    (ES, DE, GR and UK, with a large SME component, a water authority, a water utility
    and a big water sector companies association) will validate the project outcomes
    in 2 different pilots: (1) Ter-Llobregat water supply system (ES) representing
    water-stressed parts of Europe and (2) Karlsruhe water supply system (DE) representing
    more water-rich regions. WatERP enables improved matching of water supply and
    demand from a holistic point of view, pursuing 2 objectives: (i) improving coordination
    among actors and (ii) fostering behavioural change to reduce water (8%) and energy
    (5%) consumption. By enabling a more dynamic and agile interaction among the different
    actors involved in water supply distribution, the platform improves water governance
    while maintaining the autonomy and independence of the actors. WatERP will also
    develop a strong dissemination capability, besides an evaluation of their anticipated
    cost and benefits and market prospects.'

  Technology_Description: 'Over the past four years, Rijkswaterstaat, the Highways
    Agency and the Roads and Traffic Agency  have worked together to share knowledge
    and approaches to solving common problems. This relationship is embedded in a
    joint Memorandum of Agreement.The organisations are very similar and share many
    of the same problems and challenges in managing their Strategic Road Network (SRN).
    Each organisation faces issues in addressing rising cost of ownership of traffic
    management systems due to end-of-life traffic technology systems which have strong
    vendor lock-in.  Neither organisation can solve its problems by purchasing existing
    commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions in the traffic technology market because
    the traffic technology market has been slow to adopt a COTS approach. It is only
    via aggregated demand of the leading SRN operators that the market can be expanded
    and costs reduced. Both organisations wish to decouple the technology solutions
    from the business requirements so that the business is free to implement new operating
    models and realise significant efficiency savings.Without embarking on this programme,
    the HA will experience accelerated technology maintenance costs, reduced reliability,
    an inability to cost effectively meet the demands of Traffic Management Directorate
    (TMD) arising from the implementation of the Future Operating Model (FOM), and
    jeopardise TMD''s programme of efficiency savings. Without this programme RWS
    will experience a lack of business flexibility.The CHARM programme has two primary
    objectives:'

  Technology_Description: 'Improving the efficiency of water management in Europe
    was recognised by the EC as essential for overcoming the growing exposure of European
    countries to Water Scarcity and Droughts. UrbanWater proposes a platform that
    will enable a better end-to-end water management in urban areas, accounting for
    17% of freshwater consumption in the EU.The project will undertake the development,
    demonstration, and economic up-scaling of an innovative ICT-based platform for
    the efficient integrated management of water resources. The system will benefit
    end-users, utilities, public authorities, the environment and the general public,
    in terms of: (i) providing consumers with comprehensive tools enabling them to
    use water more efficiently thereby reducing overall consumption; (ii) helping
    water utilities to meet demand at reduced costs; and (iii) fostering new partnerships
    between water authorities, utility, equipment and software companies so as to
    ensure the successful commercialisation of the system and the evolution of the
    European water sector as a global leader.The system will incorporate advanced
    metering solutions, real-time communication of consumption data and new data management
    technologies with real-time predictive capability, demand forecasting, consumption
    pattern interpretation, decision support systems, adaptive pricing and user empowerment
    solutions.The UrbanWater consortium includes ICT companies, research organisations
    and water utilities with complementary capacities and all the know-how required
    to oversee the successful completion of the project. Threewater distributors included
    in the group will undertake large-scale validations with their urban users, thus
    promoting a final outcome that is close to the market and to the end-users.'

  Technology_Description: 'This project addresses three main management problems in
    urban water system: optimal operational control, real-time monitoring and demand
    forecasting/management. Real-time optimal control deals with operating the main
    flow and pressure actuators to meet demands using the most sustainable sources
    and minimizing electricity costs and is tackled using stochastic model predictive
    control techniques. Real-time monitoring of water quantity and quality refers
    to the continuous detection  and location of leakage and or water quality problems.
    It uses fault detection and diagnosis techniques. Demand forecasting and management
    is based on smart metering techniques and includes detailed modelling of consumption
    patterns as well as a service of communication to consumers. The project will
    provide an integrated software platform and two real-life pilot demonstrations
    in Barcelona (Spain) and Lemesos (Cyprus), respectively.'

  Technology_Description: NRG4Cast is developing real-time management, analytics and
    forecasting services for energy distribution networks in urban/rural communities.
    We are analysing information regarding network topology and devices, energy demand
    and consumption, environmental data and energy prices data.The services that will
    be integrated in a software module pipeline providing prediction and the decision
    support system based on network monitoring, anomaly detection, route cause analysis,
    trend detection, planning and optimisation. These services will be using advanced
    knowledge technologies in particular machine learning, data and text mining, stream
    mining, link analysis, information extraction, knowledge formalisation and reasoning.The
    platform will be tested in the two orthogonal case studies energy efficiency in
    municipalities and energy efficiency in city districts.  The two case studies
    will be complemented with the additional energy networks operated by project partners;
    electric vehicles network, public lighting system and energy positive buildings.
    The proposal concentrates on electric power networks through the development of
    a generic framework that will be able to control, manage, analyse and predict
    behaviour in an extensible manner on other energy networks like gas distribution,
    heat water distribution and alternative energy distribution networks. For these
    reasons a generic toolkit with programmable data adapters will also be developed.Proposal
    gathers highly competent RTD organisations, developers, energy operators and case
    studies from four European countries. The project is led by JSI, has a consortium
    of 8 partners from 4 different countries and will run for 36 months.

  - PANDORA
  Technology_Description: Autonomous robots are not very good at being autonomous.
    Operating in real environments, they easily get stuck, often ask for help, and
    generally succeed only when attempting simple tasks in well-known situations.
    PANDORA is a three year project that will develop and evaluate new computational
    methods to make human-built robots Persistently Autonomous, significantly reducing
    the frequency of assistance requests. The key to this is an ability to recognise
    failure and respond to it, at all levels of abstraction and time constant.Three
    themes for this will be explored, working synergistically together A. DESCRIBING
    THE WORLD will develop new probabilistic semantic representations of the environment
    and the state of task execution, driven by feature based localisation and world
    model update from sensors, and by focus of attention mechanisms. This will detect
    failure of task execution and its context. B. DIRECTING AND ADAPTING INTENTIONS
    will investigate planning and plan adaption under resource constraint and uncertainty
    in response to goals and the changing world above.  This will enable the robot
    to respond strategically to action failure(s) C. ACTING ROBUSTLY will investigate
    the interface between re-enforcement/imitation learning methods and robust control
    to make action execution indifferent to unwanted motion of target or self. Following
    the Deep Water Horizon oilfield disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, contractors
    are developing hover capable autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for subsea
    inspection and intervention. PANDORA's key goal will be to make such vehicles
    more Persistently Autonomous. Under the guidance of major industrial players,
    validation tasks of Inspection, cleaning and valve turning will be trialled with
    partners' AUVs in Scotland and Spain. To focus theoretical developments and partner
    interactions, an agile approach to system integration will be employed, opportunistically  capturing
    new developments from the three themes above into more capable prototypes.

  Project_ACR:
  - MORPH
  Technology_Description: 'The MORPH project advances the novel concept of an underwater
    robotic system composed of a number of spatially separated mobile robot-modules,
    carrying distinct and yet complementary resources. Instead of being physically
    coupled, the modules are connected via virtual links that rely on the flow of
    information among them, i. e. inter-module interactions are allowed by underwater
    communication networks at distant and close ranges and supported by visual perception
    at very close range. The MORPH supra-vehicle (MSV) is thus in sharp contrast to
    classical monolithic vehicles or even cooperative groups of marine vehicles that
    operate safely away from each other. These lack the capability of mutual support
    and multi-sensor interaction.Without rigid links, the MSV can reconfigure itself
    and adapt in response to the shape of the terrain. This capability provides the
    foundation for efficient methods to map the underwater environment with great
    accuracy especially in situations that defy existing technology: namely, underwater
    surveys over rugged terrain and structures with full 3D complexity. This includes
    walls with a negative slope, where precise localization of a single vehicle is
    not possible.The possible applications of the MSV cover a wide range of scientific
    and commercial areas such as monitoring of cold water coral reefs, oil and gas
    pipeline inspection, or harbor and dam protection. The common characteristic of
    these areas is the need for operating multiple, complementary instruments at very
    close range to unstructured underwater terrain while accomplishing proper geo-referencing
    at the same time.The MORPH concept requires qualitatively new behaviors such as
    adaptive sensor placement for perception and navigation, as well as environmental
    modeling in complex environments. On site view planning will lead to a solution
    well beyond the operational state of the art for underwater cliff surveys and
    other similar missions. A final demonstration on a vertical cliff, unfeasible
    automatically with today''s technology, will validate the efficacy of the methods
    developed.'

  - FOODSNIFFER
  Technology_Description: 'Concern for our food is growing in Europe, driven by industrialised
    food production and repeated crises. Current analytical technology is too expensive
    and bound to the laboratory to test more than a small fraction of 1% of the EU''s
    food. This problem requires more massive screening of food and water extending
    from the source to the point of consumption. A low-cost and portable system delivering
    analytical data to a central location would help to prevent or identify early
    any food safety threat outbreaks and thereby massively reduce human suffering
    and its associated financial cost on both sides of the global divide. FOODSNIFFER
    is field-deployable and simple-to-use as a result of the integration of three
    major innovations: (i) the transducer itself, an all-silicon fully integrated
    optoelectronic platform based on Broad-Band Mach-Zehnder Interferometry capable
    of synchronous highly-sensitive label-free multi-analyte detection. This ultimately-integrated
    transducer due to the incorporation of the light-sources, sensing elements, spectral
    analyzer and photodetectors, in a single chip, can be used in single-shot cartridges.
    (ii) the innovative design of the wafer-scale microfluidics and filtration systems
    that unburden the reader of external pumps/valves, and intensive sample preparation.
    (iii) the development of a low-power reader controlled by a smartphone through
    a custom-produced application. The software controls the sensor and also processes
    its signal and then sends the results securely via the internet during the on-the-spot
    food safety analysis. FOODSNIFFER is a complete business solution which will be
    demonstrated in three areas of great importance to European society and regulators,
    viz. the detection of pesticide residues, mycotoxins and allergens in selected
    food categories in order to demonstrate field-based detection of harmful species
    at low concentrations, which is a feat unattained so far by any point-of-need
    system.'

    about smart metering technologies in order to develop novel, robust, practical
    and cost-effective methodologies and tools to manage urban water demand in households
    across Europe, by reducing wastage, improving utility understanding of end-user
    demand and reducing customer water and energy costs.The main scientific challenges
    for iWIDGET are the management and extraction of useful information from vast
    amounts of high-resolution consumption data, the development of customised intervention
    and awareness campaigns to influence behavioural change, and the integration of
    iWIDGET concepts into a set of decision-support tools for water utilities and
    consumers, applicable in differing local conditions.In order to meet these aims
    and challenges, iWIDGET will investigate: (i) how best to provide the dynamic
    accurate measurement and data transfer of useful information about end-user water
    consumption, (ii) how best to use consumption data to improve the operation of
    utilities and influence end-users to modify their behaviour, (iii) how to arrive
    at the best business model to convert a promising technology into a useful and
    cost-effective product, and (iv) how to demonstrate and validate the new methodologies
    on two case studies in the North and South of Europe.'

  Technology_Description: 'We aim at designing, prototyping, and validating a new
    generation of ICT hardware and software technologies inspired from plant roots,
    called PLANTOIDS, endowed with distributed sensing, actuation, and intelligence
    for tasks of environmental exploration and monitoring. PLANTOIDS take inspiration
    from, and aim at reproducing, the amazing penetration, exploration, and adaptation
    capabilities of plant roots. Plants have evolved very robust growth behaviours
    to respond to changes in their environment and a network of highly sensorized
    branching roots to efficiently explore the soil volume, mining minerals and up-taking
    water. PLANTOID has two major goals: 1) to abstract and synthesize with robotic
    artefacts the principles that enable plant roots to effectively and efficiently
    explore and adapt to underground environments; 2) to formulate scientifically
    testable hypotheses and models of some unknown aspects of plant roots, such as
    the role of local communication among root apices during adaptive growth and the
    combination of rich sensory information to produce collective decisions. The PLANTOID
    artefact will be composed of a network of sensorized and actuated roots, displaying
    rich sensing and coordination capabilities as well as energy-efficient actuation
    and high sustainability, typical of the Plant Kingdom. Each PLANTOID root will
    consist of an apex that comprises sensors, actuators, control units, and by an
    elongation zone that mechanically connects the apex and the trunk of the robot.
    The new technologies expected to result from PLANTOID concern energy-efficient
    actuation systems, chemical and physical micro-sensors, sensor fusion techniques,
    kinematics models, and distributed, adaptive control in networked structures with
    local information and communication capabilities. The foundational research program
    of PLANTOID will be carried out by a consortium of engineers, plant biologists,
    and computer scientists with demonstrated experience in interdisciplinary work.'
