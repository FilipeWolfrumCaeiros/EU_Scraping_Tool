    <Technology_Description>Mastitis is one of the most widespread and costly diseases in the dairy industry, inflicting serious damages on a global scale.In herds without an effective mastitis control program, 40 % of cows are infected every 6 months.
      Treatment of mastitis costs ca. €185 per cow per year. Antibiotic treatment is currently the only solution for treating bacterial mastitis. The antibiotic treatment causes very large losses in milk production and degradation of milk quality, and
      creates bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics. For many years, scientists all over the world tried to find a non-antibiotic treatment against mastitis. We have developed a highly innovative technology that heals mastitis without resorting to
      antibiotics. Based on the energetic signature of mastitis pathogens received from the farm computer, our system processes the cows’ drinking water using radio emissions. Infected cows that drink the treated water are healed from mastitis without the
      need for antibiotics. A working prototype of the system was tested at a 300-cows dairy farm, successfully healing 39 out of the 49 sick cows. Apart from the healing effect, the new treatment facilitates compliance with major EU health regulations.
      The project will study the requirements for large scale production and delivery of the technology to the dairy industry. It will boost the EU business in milk production and create large environmental, economic and social benefits. Market drivers and
      a 5-year growth potential will be analysed and a commercialisation strategy will be devised, along with an IPR protection strategy, analysis of competing technologies and planning of promotional and partnership activities. This will enable us to
      redesign the technology for serial production and scale up for a successful market entry.</Technology_Description>

    <Technology_Description>Critical water infrastructures and high profile (soft) targets are vulnerable to intentional drinking water contamination. Physical access is difficult to control and traditional water quality monitoring solutions are largely
      inadequate to protect the water distribution process and its consumers. In light of increasing security threats there is a strong need amongst water suppliers and authorities, in Europe and globally, for a contaminant warning system that can be
      deployed in the distribution network and that provides real-time water quality information and event classification to support rapid decision making and protect the health of citizens.</Technology_Description>

    <Technology_Description>Shortage of fresh water has become one of the major challenges for societies all over the world. Water desalination offers an opportunity to significantly increase the freshwater supply for drinking, industrial use and
      irrigation. All current desalination technologies require significant electrical or thermal energy, with today's Reverse Osmosis (RO) desalination units consuming electric energy of at least 3 kWh/m3 – in extensive tests about ten years ago, the
      Affordable Desalination Collaboration (ADC) in California measured 1.6 kWh/m3 for RO power consumption on the best commercially available membranes, and total plant energy about twice as high.

    <Technology_Description>Three out of four people in EU drink water from groundwater subjected to severe nitrate contamination by fertilizers and sanitary products used in intensive agriculture &amp; farming. High levels of nitrates in drinking water
      put human health at risk and have been reported to threaten 26% of EU biodiversity. Current technologies do not meet the needs of small water suppliers, who must face costs derived from high energy consumption (3-7 kWh/m3), poor nitrate selectivity,
      residual streams and by-products, and continuous costly maintenance. 33% of suppliers in Europe are not compliant with quality standards, particularly nitrate levels. ZIRONITRO is the result of 8 years of research and development by Ofra Aqua Plants,
      an Israeli company with over 25 years’ experience in bioengineering and phytoremediation. Based on the concept of using nature to cleanse nature, ZIRONITRO is a constructed wetland to biologically treat groundwater by removing nitrates to obtain
      high-quality drinking water (98% removal), at 84% lower cost than current. ZIRONITRO’s innovation resides in the system’s nitrate removal specificity, with a design that allows low-cost operation and maintenance, along with very high rates of nitrate
      breakdown by bacteria. The key factor is the selection of the best combination of both bacteria and plants, along with the optimal proportion of methanol as carbon source. The particular environment we have generated inside our ponds reduces
      hydraulic retention time by 90% and uses 100 times less ethanol than current constructed wetlands. Indeed, we do not use synthetic chemicals, energy input needed is negligible, and neither residuals nor wastewater are generated, so it has no negative
      impact on the environment. On the contrary, it contributes to both biodiversity conservation and landscape value. For 2020-2022, we forecast €61.3 M cumulative revenues (profitability ratio of 12%), increasing workforce to 40 people.</Technology_Description>

    <Technology_Description>The objective of the pHenom project is to produce the next generation pH sensor capable of accurate, calibration free and smart operation, with integral quality and control. Development and commercialisation of this smart
      sensor, named the “pHenom” will provide a revolutionary pH sensor that meets the ocean monitoring and water management needs. Beyond the ocean monitoring and water management industries, the global pH meter market is expected to reach nearly £1.48 bn
      by 2022. The pH meter market is segmented into bench top (55% share - £815m), portable, and continuous pH meters. pHims technology can deliver to all three and has the potential to meet a wide range of needs within the segments; pharmaceuticals and
      biotechnology, food science (41% share), water and waste treatment, research institutes and environmental control boards. Despite US dominance, in 2014, Europe was the highest revenue generating region at 32% due to the high level of R&amp;D
      activities, advanced healthcare, and industrial infrastructure. Drivers are new technology (microprocessors for auto temperature and pressure compensation), growing health concerns and regulatory pressure to monitor environmental pollution (waste
      water pH in industries such as chemicals, pharmaceuticals, food processing) and the need to regulate pH levels (routine testing of soil, water, food, beverage, and dairy products). The objective of this feasibility study is to carry out activities
      that enable the provision of a comprehensive feasibility report with conclusions, recommendations and a specification of the Phase 2 project objectives, together with a detailed marketing and business plan for the development and commercialisation of
      pHims.</Technology_Description>

    <Technology_Description>Management and maintenance of pipe systems present a major problem: leaks. The existence of leaks is costly, both economic and environmental terms, especially when considering finite resources. The ISPNET project proposes a
      new smart pipe system for early detection of leaks and preventive maintenance of networks, including a last generation of transmission system specifically tested for water distribution, but with further application in other fluids’ transportation
      networks (oil &amp; gas, industrial liquids…). The new system, which has been installed and subject to public trials, will optimize the properties of existing piping systems and in turn, serve as reporter element of all incidents occurring in the
      pipe system and as management tool of parameters commonly used. The solution offer innovative advantages both in terms of the materials used for the pipe and due to the monitoring and traceability possibilities of the embedded sensor system. There is
      no other similar system in the market, and the cost per meter of the system is lower than “conventional” ones. SME INSTRUMENT Phase 1 will help to define requirements to validate the product in different configurations (dimensions, monitoring
      functionalities) and uses (drinking water and other fluids), as well as to automate the production process. Through a feasibility study, ABN will measure the potential of the solution in terms of efficiency, business opportunity and compliance with
      standards, analyze the commercial impact of the device and define the market in concrete and realistic terms, in order to attract investors. All this will reduce time to market for a very promising solution, which has received expression of interest
      of major water distrubution companies. It has also been recently (April 2015) awarded at first Ideas Competition (Sustainability award) launched by the Spanish network of Smart and Innovative Cities RED INNPULSO.</Technology_Description>

    <Technology_Description>Currently, the bioplastics industry is restricted by the high cost of PHA and PHB bioplastics, despite the global capacity for their production outstripping commonly-used hydrocarbon-based thermoplastics and alternative
      bioplastic solutions; contemporary bioplastics that can compete with hydrocarbon thermoplastics are derived from crops (primarily using starch compounds), creating a conflict between using crops for food or as an industrial raw material, and
      increasing the cost of food. Furthermore, wastewater presents itself as a constant burden for industry, particularly wastewater containing nutrients that can potentially lead to a high biological oxygen demand (BOD) which damages aquatic ecosystems.
      The Eggplant is an innovative two-phase water treatment procedure that filters industrial wastewater and applies a three-stage post-filtration process. Through this process, each Eggplant uses wastewater as a raw material for the production of
      bioplastics using a commercial bacterial culture. Critically, the water at the end of the process is purified and safe to be used as drinking water or for release into watercourses. The primary value of Eggplant is the reduction of waste from
      agri-food industrial wastewater from twofold to zero – filtration removes the majority of pollutants and fermentation removes organic contaminants. The resulting concentrate is then processed into PHA and PHB bioplastics. Moreover, an Eggplant,
      through the use of concentrated substrate can generate 3-4 times as much bioplastic from an equivalent volume of wastewater.</Technology_Description>

    <Technology_Description>The total global water demand is expected to rise by 35–60% until 2025 compared to the level of the year 2000, and could then double by 2050. Already today, Europe’s Mediterranean regions suffer from water scarcity and thereof
      foremost the food sector, accounting for 80% of freshwater demand while representing a decisive economic factor in that regions. Depending strongly on secure and sustainable water supply, green technologies for water treatment are needed to safeguard
      its economic prosperity. Against this background WTS has developed an innovative, energy-efficient and sustainable technology for decentralised seawater desalination to generate high-quality potable water cost-efficiently (by using special high
      performance heat exchanger technology) and environmentally-friendly (using waste heat as energy input and avoiding salt pollution). The system provided in a sea container is portable and easily scalable imitating a weather-like cycle. The WTS
      solution is advantageous related to state of the art technology w.r.t. energy use, environmental burden and costs. The key market application is decentralized water production for users or user groups with the need to consume water directly on site
      but face limitation on available freshwater resources (due to large distances or over-exploitation). The idea is to offer small-scale, distributed desalination for the extraction of raw water from saline water sources for 1) drinking water production
      and 2) process water production. It will be viable to use the WTS technology in Mediterranean coastal areas and islands. The global capacity of desalination plants is expected to grow with a CAGR of 11%. The project helps safeguard sustainability and
      secure food production in the Mediterranean countries and other water stressed regions. Objective is to assess the technical feasibility of Water4Food in relevant industrial environment as well as the economic justification in the first target
      markets (Greece, Cyprus, Malta).</Technology_Description>

    <Technology_Description>Safe drinking water is essentially a global concern, thus resulting in a considerably large market for water quality monitoring. Besides, potential terrorists might threaten water infrastructure in European cities, since
      poisoning the tap water is a low-cost attack that easily generates social panic and economic loss to the society. Due to lack of the ideal early warning tools on water safety, large amount of routine sampling and testing have to be done frequently to
      fight against possible CBRN threats on urban water supply. This project addresses feasibility study for the technical and economic viability of Biological Water Alarm System (BiWAS): An innovative low-cost early warning device for monitoring of
      drinking water safety over a broad spectrum of harmful substances, including (1) acute toxicant chemicals, (2) chronic carcinogenic chemicals, and (3) waterborne pathogens. The innovative content of BiWAS lies in the miniaturisation and integration
      with multidisciplinary knowledge, which makes BiWAS a continuous, automatic and portable device working for long period with only annually or biannually maintenance. The potential customers include public water suppliers, household users, hospitals,
      hotels, culinary and food industries, etc. An early warning system against CBRN threats in drinking water can be realized without more investment. A feasibility assessment on BiWAS product under Phase 1 includes market investigation, business plan
      development, risk assessment, intellectual property management and innovation strategy development. In the potential Phase 2, a commercializable prototype of BiWAS will be expected, which can be probably the first low-cost and broad-spectrum early
      warning device for water safety. With the outcome of Phase 1, it will guide the European companies towards the leading role of the global water quality monitoring techniques, and open a big door to the large market of global water quality monitoring,
      from Europe to the world.</Technology_Description>
