It involves heating biomass in the absence of oxygen to a temperature of 200 to 320 °C. As a result, the biomass looses all its moisture and becomes easy to grind and water resistant, which reduces the risk of spontaneous ignition and biological degradation and permits outdoor storage. By combining torrefaction with pelletisation or briquetting, biomass is converted into a high-energy-density commodity solid fuel or bioenergy carrier with superior properties in view of (long-distance) transport, handling and storage, and also in many major end-use applications (e.g., co-firing in pulverised-coal fired power plants, (co-)gasification in entrained-flow gasifiers and combustion in distributed pellet boilers.

The vision is to build on recent progress in synthetic biology and develop novel photosynthetic cyanobacteria as chassis to be used as self-sustained cell factories in generating a solar fuel. This will include the development of a toolbox with orthogonal parts and devices for cyanobacterial synthetic biology, improvement of the chassis enabling enhanced growth and robustness in challenging environmental conditions, establishment of a data warehouse facilitating the modelling and optimization of cyanobacterial metabolic pathways, and strong and novel bioinformatics for effective data mining. To reach the goal, a combination of basic and applied R&D is needed; basic research to design and construct the cyanobacterial cells efficiently evolving H2 from the endless resources solar energy and water, and applied research to design and construct the advanced photobioreactors that efficiently produce H2. Biosafety is of highest concern and dedicated efforts will be made to address and control cell survival and death. The aim, to develop a (photo)synthetic cell factory, will have an enormous impact on the future options and possibilities for renewable solar fuel production. The consortium includes academic, research institute and industry participants with the direct involvement of two SMEs in the advanced photobioreactor design, construction and use. Purpose-designed, specifically engineered self-sustained cells utilising solar energy and CO2 from the air, may be the mechanisms and processes by which we generate large scale renewable energy carriers in our future societies.

The goal is to achieve 25% energy savings compared to current state of the art systems, with still competitive prices on the market. Thus, the work proposed aims for a seasonal performance factor of the system (solar and heat pump) of e.g. 6 as compared to 4.5 for the current state of the art. This will be possible by using new materials, components and ICT in an integrative approach for new system concepts where the focus is on the overall system's cost and performance. A systematic approach will be used to evaluate new breakthroughs such as e.g. low-cost materials and selective paint for solar collectors that collect solar irradiation as well as ambient heat and PV/T collectors that produce heat as well as electricity. Exergetic optimization of heat pump circuits includes using de-superheating heat exchangers for DHW preparation as a by-product of the more efficient space heating operation, and variable speed controlled compressors for heat pumps that match the collector heat input to the evaporator and/or the demand. New storage concepts include phase change materials (PCM) on the cold side of the heat pump, low cost materials for storage tank construction, improved temperature stratification and charging/discharging control. On the control and ICT side, weather and user forecast based predictive control for intelligent storage charging by different heat sources will help to increase the overall system performance significantly.

To decrease uncertainties around wind farm wake predictions, a small measurement campaign together with the new data available from the industry partners will enable better tuning, and eventually better modelling of the far-field of wind farm wakes.  With the large amount of offshore wind farms to be built in the next years, clusters of wind farms will appear at favourable locations, like in the German Bight and Dogger Bank. Large arrays of floating wind farms planned near long-distance grid cables independent of water depth will also start to appear in the next years. The planning and design of these clusters pose new challenges with regards to the siting of the connected wind farms, the design of the interconnecting grid structure and the integration of the large amount of power into the electricity supply systems. The concept of the EERA-DTOC project is to combine this expertise in a common integrated software tool for the optimised design of offshore wind farms and wind farm clusters acting as wind power plants. The only point less well known, due to the lack of good data so far, is the behaviour of the wind farm wake, in particular far-field wake. Therefore, a small measurement campaign is planned and collection of lidar data and high-resolution satellite images to get better data. Key industry actors working as end users of the software will help in the design of the tool, and will afterwards verify the performance of the tool using their own data and test cases.",,"2015-06-30, closed project","<meta name=""WT.cg_s"" content=""FP7-ENERGY"">",FP7-ENERGY-2011-1,CP - Collaborative project (generic),Denmark,"Higher or Secondary Education Establishments,Karen Hyllested Thielsen,Tel.: +45 4677 5018,Research Organisations,Christoph Schulte,Tel.: +49 89 1205 2728,Fax: +49 89 1205 7534,Research Organisations,Elena Arbizu,Tel.: +34948252800,Fax: +34948270774,Research Organisations,Maaike Brouwer,Tel.: +31 224 564085,Other,Dorina Iuga,Tel.: +32 2 213 1809,Fax: +32 2 213 1890,Research Organisations,Magnus Korpås,Tel.: +47 73 59 72 29,Higher or Secondary Education Establishments,Joerg Stahlmann,Tel.: +49 441 798 5443,Fax: +49 441 798 2503,Research Organisations,Antonia Dimou,Tel.: +302106603300,Fax: +302106603301,Research Organisations,Ana Collados,Tel.: +34 913466096,Fax: +34 913466480,Higher or Secondary Education Establishments,Mafalda Marques Moreira Soeiro,Tel.: +351225082171,Fax: +351225081440,Higher or Secondary Education Establishments,Martin Gregory,Tel.: +441415483707,Higher or Secondary Education Establishments,Bethany Wuensch,Tel.: +8128550516,Private for-profit entities (excluding Higher or Secondary Education Establishments),Alexis Mouche,Tel.: +33 298 057 688,Private for-profit entities (excluding Higher or Secondary Education Establishments),øyvind Kristiansen,Tel.: +4797693616,Private for-profit entities (excluding Higher or Secondary Education Establishments),Carlos Lozano,Tel.: +34913257593,Private for-profit entities (excluding Higher or Secondary Education Establishments),Wei He,Tel.: +47 99311556,Private for-profit entities (excluding Higher or Secondary Education Establishments),Hans-Peter Waldl,Tel.: +49 441 361163 33,Fax: +49 441 361163 10,Private for-profit entities (excluding Higher or Secondary Education Establishments),Daniel Brickwell,Tel.: +49 42159 66 0 469,Fax: +49 421 59 66 0 420,Private for-profit entities (excluding Higher or Secondary Education Establishments),Stig Anders Ingemar Tunbjer,Tel.: +46 708 429480,Other,Ranjit Mene,Tel.: +44 207 832 4658,Private for-profit entities (excluding Higher or Secondary Education Establishments),Kristian Höy-Thomsen,Tel.: +46 702 95 91 41,Private for-profit entities (excluding Higher or Secondary Education Establishments),Peter Stuart,Tel.: +44 1923299238,Private for-profit entities (excluding Higher or Secondary Education Establishments),Carlos Lozano,Tel.: +34 913257593",,EUR 2 899 857,282797,ENERGY.2011.2.3-2 - Development of design tools for Offshore Wind farm clusters

International cooperation has been arranged with high-profile institutions from the USA, Canada and Australia that have crucial expertise in geological storage of CO2.
