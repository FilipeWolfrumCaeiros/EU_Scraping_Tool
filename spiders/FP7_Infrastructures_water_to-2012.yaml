  Technology_Description: Our responses to many urgent social and economic challenges
    facing Europe will be based upon our understanding of the composition, properties
    and dynamics of the subsurface. Such challenges include sustainable supply of
    energy, water, and mineral resources; mitigation of natural hazards for the health
    and safety of EU citizens, containing hazardous substances (e.g. radioactive waste,
    contaminants); mitigating climate change by exploiting renewable energy and capturing
    and storing greenhouse gases; and addressing conflicting claims on the use of
    subsurface space. Digital geological data are the evidence upon which our responses
    to these challenges must be based.The potential role of geological data as an
    engine for economic growth and recovery is also significant at this time of unprecedented
    economic stresses within Europe and globally. Our earth provides rare elements
    and metals essential to rapidly emerging technologies in fields such as telecommunications
    and renewable energy.Europe's National Geological Survey Organisations (NGSO)
    are responsible at national levels for the acquisition, management and delivery
    of geological data and information. Based on the successes of earlier joint projects
    including 'OneGeology Europe' the joint NGSO of Europe developed EGDI-Scope to
    prepare the ground for a "European Geological Data Infrastructure (EGDI)". The
    need for such an infrastructure was recognised by the European Parliament Committee
    on Industry Research and Energy in its recent report "on an effective raw materials
    strategy for Europe'. The EGDI will provide the backbone for serving interoperable,
    pan-European geological data currently held by NGSO, and data from past, ongoing
    and future European projects. EGDI-Scope will focus on:1. Developing connections
    with and gathering user requirements from EGDI end-users;2. Selecting and prioritizing
    datasets producing maximum societal benefit;3. Technical design;4. Models for
    governance and future funding of the EGDI
